Philip Rosenthal (born 1960) is an American television writer and producer who is best known as the creator, writer and executive producer for the sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond (1996–2005). The show was co-produced by Ray Romano, and based in part on Romano''s comedy material. Rosenthal''s wife, actress Monica Horan, played the role of Amy MacDougall-Barone, the off and on girlfriend (wife after season 7) of Robert Barone (Brad Garrett) in Raymond.

It was Rosenthal and Romano who decided to retire the series over the objections or reservations of the other cast members.

Rosenthal was born in Queens, New York, but spent most of his childhood living in New City, New York located in Rockland County. He attended Clarkstown North High School where he became very active in the school''s drama club, Cue ''N Curtain. During his four years at Clarkstown, Rosenthal acted in many high school plays. Among his fellow schoolmates were future television producer Alan Kirschenbaum (Yes, Dear) and New York politician Richard Holbrook. Rosenthal graduated from Clarkstown North in 1977. From there, he attended Hofstra University, where he graduated in 1981. In the early 1980s, he was an actor based out of New York City before shifting his focus to production work, becoming the writer and producer of such shows as Coach with Craig T. Nelson and the short-lived Baby Talk. However, Rosenthal occasionally appears in acting roles as evidenced by a role in James L. Brooks'' Spanglish as a business colleague of Adam Sandler''s character. Rosenthal also had a minor role in 2007''s The Simpsons Movie, a big screen adaption of the long running TV series which was also produced by Brooks and his company, Gracie Films. Rosenthal voiced the line "Here we are kids... the Grand Canyon," in the fake TV ad that Tom Hanks was filming for the United States Government in support of the "new" Grand Canyon in the film. Producers liked the line and Rosenthal asked if he could perform the part. He has also appeared in Curb Your Enthusiasm, 30 Rock, and Jake Kasdan’s feature, The TV Set.

Phil is the author of the book You''re Lucky You''re Funny: How Life Becomes a Sitcom which was released on October 21, 2006. Phil recounts how his hilarious life led to one of the most successful shows in history.

Rosenthal has the distinction of having directed President Bill Clinton in the White House Correspondents'' Dinner video, which was shown to wide acclaim at the April 2000 event.

He co-wrote the “America: A Tribute to Heroes”, the 9/11 telethon which aired on all four networks, won a Peabody Award and an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing.

He has completed his first feature for Sony Pictures: Exporting Raymond, which he wrote and directed, the true story about the attempt to turn Everybody Loves Raymond into a successful Russian sitcom, where he served as a consultant. Much of the documentary centers on his struggle with the country''s unusual cultural aspects and developing relationships with the show''s cast and crew, despite little to no knowledge with the Russians'' sense of humor.

He hosts his own radio talk show, Keepin'' It Real, and he makes regular guest appearances cable news television. In 2011, he was named the host of MSNBC''s PoliticsNation, a nightly talk show. In 2015, the program was shifted to Sunday mornings.

Sharpton''s supporters praise "his ability and willingness to defy the power structure that is seen as the cause of their suffering" and consider him "a man who is willing to tell it like it is". Former Mayor of New York City Ed Koch, a one-time foe, said that Sharpton deserves the respect he enjoys among black Americans: "He is willing to go to jail for them, and he is there when they need him." President Barack Obama said that Sharpton is "the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden." A 2013 Zogby Analytics poll found that one quarter of African Americans said that Sharpton speaks for them.

His critics describe him as "a political radical who is to blame, in part, for the deterioration of race relations". Sociologist Orlando Patterson has referred to him as a racial arsonist, while liberal columnist Derrick Z. Jackson has called him the black equivalent of Richard Nixon and Pat Buchanan. Sharpton sees much of the criticism as a sign of his effectiveness. "In many ways, what they consider criticism is complimenting my job," he said. "An activist''s job is to make public civil rights issues until there can be a climate for change."

But if you heard her, that might be a horse of a different color. Marni is one of those unsung heroes (or should I say "much sung" heroes) whose incredible talents were given short shrift at the time. For those who think film superstars such as Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn possessed not only powerhouse dramatic talents but amazing singing voices as well...think again. Kerr''s Anna in The King and I (1956), Natalie''s Maria in West Side Story (1961), and Audrey''s Eliza in My Fair Lady (1964) were all dubbed by the amazing Marni Nixon, and nowhere in the credits will you find that fact. Born Marni McEathron in Altadena, California, she was a former child actress and soloist with the Roger Wagner Chorale in the beginning. Trained in opera, yet possessing a versatile voice for pop music and easy standards as well, she not only sang for Arnold Schönberg and Igor Stravinsky but also recorded light songs. Marni made her Broadway musical debut in 1954 in a show that lasted two months but nothing came from it. In 1955, the singer contracted to dub Deborah Kerr in The King and I (1956) was killed in a car accident in Europe and a replacement was needed. Marni was hired...and the rest is history. Much impressed, the studios brought her in to "ghost" Ms. Kerr''s voice once again in the classic tearjerker An Affair to Remember (1957). From there she went on to make Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn sound incredibly good with such classic songs as "Tonight" and "Wouldn''t It Be Loverly."

She finally appeared on screen in a musical in The Sound of Music (1965) starring Julie Andrews, who physically resembles Marni. The role is a small one, however, and she is only given a couple of solo lines in "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?" as a singing nun. Marni''s vocal career in films dissolved by the mid 1960s, but she continued on with concerts and in symphony halls, while billing herself as "The Voice of Hollywood" in one-woman cabaret shows. Throughout the years, she has played on the legit stage, including the lead roles in "The King and I" and "The Sound of Music," and in her matronly years has been seen as Fraulein Schneider in "Cabaret," and in the musicals "Follies" and "70 Girls 70." Her last filmed singing voice was as the grandmother in the animated feature Mulan (1998) in the 1990s. Married three times, twice to musicians; one of her husbands, Ernest Gold, by whom she had three children, was a film composer and is best known for his Academy Award-winning epic Exodus (1960).

Lyons, the son of Garrett Thomas Lyons and Wilhamena Johnson Lyons, was raised on a South Dakota farm, though his family lived for a time in Memphis, TN, where he attended business school. An expert horseman, he gave up the notion of a business career and opted for the rodeo arena instead, touring the country;y and eventually reaching Los Angeles at the age of 21. With accomplished cowboys in great demand, Lyons quickly became involved in movies, working both as a stuntman and an actor. After only a couple of bit parts, he was signed by producer Bud Barsky to do seven inexpensive Westerns directed by Paul Hurst, with Lyons and Al Hoxie alternating as the hero and the heavy. Lyons and Hoxie alternated in another Western series produced by Morris R. Schlank, and, as Cliff ''Tex'' Lyons, he seemed headed for minor stardom as a B-Western lead. However, Lyons'' voice was not well-suited for sound and the talkie revolution confined him to small roles. As his small shot at stardom faded, however, his career as a stunt double for stars big and small was on the rise. He doubled such cowboy stars as Tom Mix, Ken Maynard, Buck Jones and Johnny Mack Brown. In 1936 he worked with John Wayne for the first and struck up a personal and business relationship that would remain strong for three decades. Wayne was influential in getting Lyons his first work as a second-unit director and in introducing Lyons to John Ford, for whom Lyons would do some of his finest work. Lyons'' reputation as a stunt coordinator is comparable to that of acknowledged master Yakima Canutt, with whom Lyons partnered on numerous occasions. Perhaps Lyons'' most impressive work was the massive and dynamic battle sequences of Wayne''s The Alamo (1960). He was married from 1938 to 1955 to actress Beth Marion, with whom he had two sons. Cliff Lyons died in 1974 at 72, not long after coordinating stunts for Wayne''s The Train Robbers (1973).

Jester Joseph Hairston (July 9, 1901 – January 18, 2000) was an American composer, songwriter, arranger, choral conductor, and actor. He was regarded as a leading expert on Negro spirituals and choral music. His notable compositions include "Amen," a gospel-tinged theme from the film Lilies of the Field and a 1963 hit for The Impressions, and the Christmas song "Mary''s Boy Child".

He sang with the Hall Johnson Choir in Harlem for a time but was nearly fired from the all black choir because he had difficulty with the rural dialects that were used in some of the songs. He had to shed his Boston accent and relearn the country speech of his parents and grandparents. Johnson had told him, "We''re singing ain''t and cain''t and you''re singing shahn''t and cahn''t and they don''t mix in a spiritual." The Hall Johnson Choir performed in many Broadway shows including The Green Pastures. In 1936, they were asked to go to Hollywood to sing for the film The Green Pastures. At that time, a Russian composer, Dimitri Tiomkin, heard Jester and invited him to collaborate with him. This led to a thirty-year collaboration during which time Jester arranged and collected music for the movies. In 1939, Hairston married Margaret Swanigan. He also wrote and arranged spirituals for Hollywood films as well as for high school and college choirs around the country.

Hairston wrote the song "Mary''s Boy Child" in 1956. He also arranged the song "Amen", which he dubbed for the Sidney Poitier film Lilies of the Field, and arranged traditional Negro spirituals. Most of Hairston''s film work was in the field of composing, arranging, and choral conducting. Hairston also acted in over 20 films, mostly in small roles, some of which were uncredited. Among the films he appeared in were bit parts in some of the early Tarzan movies, St. Louis Blues, The Alamo, To Kill a Mockingbird, In the Heat of the Night, Lady Sings the Blues, I''m Gonna Git You Sucka and Being John Malkovich.

In 1961, the US State Department appointed Jester Hairston as Goodwill Ambassador. He traveled all over the world teaching and performing the folk music of the slaves. In the 1960s he held choral festivals with public high school choirs, introducing them to Negro Spiritual music, and sometimes leading several hundred students in community performances. His banter about the history of the songs along with his engaging personality and sense of humor endeared him to many students.

Hairston appeared on TV''s The Amos ''n'' Andy Show. He had the role of Leroy on the radio program and as Henry Van Porter on the television program. He also played the role of Wildcat on the show That''s My Mama. In his senior years he appeared in the show Amen as Rolly Forbes. His last television appearance was in 1993 on an episode of Family Matters. Hairston also played the role of "King Moses" on radio for the Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall show Bold Venture.

Hairston died in Los Angeles of natural causes in 2000 at age 98. Born in 1901, Hairston''s life spanned each year of the 20th century. For his contribution to the television industry, Hairston has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6201 Hollywood Blvd. He is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California.', NULL, 1, '/7QsZ0GiXsgWVfxqoG2Y2Pl7F3Sy.jpg'),

Her major characters of note have included Elizabeth, a loud but cheerful little girl; Lulu, a curious monster (whom D''Abruzzo helped to develop[1]); and most recently in Season 34, Baby Bear''s little sister, Curly Bear.  D''Abruzzo first made contact with the Muppets through David Rudman. Rudman informed D''Abruzzo that The Jim Henson Company was having a huge casting call for female performers. She went to New York to auditioned, made all the cuts, but was only place in a talent pool that would not necessarily guarantee her future work. A few months later, she went back to participate in a month-long workshop in New York and slowly started becoming a Muppet Performer on Sesame Street. Her first day of performing was November 3, 1993 in episode 3162 where she played Monster #3.[2]  D''Abruzzo has performed and voiced nearly 200 characters for various projects including Oobi (playing Uma and Inka), Bear in the Big Blue House,Donna''s Day, The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, Binyah Binyah!, The Puzzle Place, Rory''s Place (for which she co-wrote a pair of episodes with husband Craig Shemin), Sheep in the Big City and The Book of Pooh (playing the inquisitive bird Kessie).  Despite her extensive work with the Muppets, D''Abruzzo first gained greater recognition as an original cast member of the puppet musical Avenue Qwhere she originated the characters of Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut. Her performance garnered her a 2004 Tony nomination, a Theatre World Award, a special Outer Critics Circle Award (for Outstanding Ensemble and Puppet Artistry), as well as a 2003 Drama Desk nomination for the show''s Off-Broadway run. In December 2005, D''Abruzzo ended her run with the project after more than two and a half years to pursue roles in I Love You Because, and worked with Bobby Lopez again on the studio album for the Walt Disney World stage show Finding Nemo: the Musical (as Sheldon and Deb). Her previous stage credits include Skitch Henderson''s New Faces of 2004 at Carnegie Hall, Carnival and Chess.  D''Abruzzo''s television credits outside of her work as a puppeteer include an appearance on the musical episode of Scrubs and as a commentator on I Love the 70s: Volume 2.

They were honored by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce by placing the Watson family star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6674 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, California.

Watson was best known for his role as "Pee Wee" in the 1938 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Boys Town and its sequel Men of Boys Town (1941), both starring Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney. Tracy and Watson became good friends during the making of the first film, and Watson was reportedly Tracy''s last visitor before his death in 1967. In 1939, Watson delivered a fine, tear-jerking performance as Pud, Lionel Barrymore''s grandson, in the MGM film, On Borrowed Time. Watson later made guest appearances in many television programs, including The Twilight Zone, Lou Grant, The Beverly Hillbillies, Green Acres, and The Fugitive.

In addition to working in the motion pictures business, Watson went to Claremont School of Theology to become a Methodist minister, inspired from the movie Boys Town. He retired after 30 years of serving in Burbank and La Cañada, California.

Award winning actor Kevin Ryan was born in Dublin, Ireland. He comes from a family of eighth-generation stonecutters, and although Kevin completed his apprenticeship as a young man, his own interests leaned more towards the arts, where he harbored a love of Shakespeare, dancing and sports. During the early years of his career, Kevin worked as a dancer which led him to appear on one of Ireland''s top television shows, and while successful, Kevin''s true passion was in acting.

Encouraged to follow his thespian path, Kevin moved to Hollywood where he continued to nurture his chosen craft, training heavily in the Stanislavski system of method acting. It was not long before Hollywood recognized Kevin''s natural talents and after several lead roles in a variety of independent movies, he was cast in his first major American role, as the lead in the thriller Tripping Tommy (2012) directed by award winning director Philippe Caland (Boxing Helena (1993), Ripple Effect (2007) ). The 2012 feature film is based on improvisation and required Kevin to give his performance with a flawless American accent.

His latest feature film is the edgy Irish romantic comedy Songs for Amy (2012) in which he plays one of the leads as an international pop-star. The movie was filmed in New York and Ireland, and also stars James Cosmo and Patrick Bergin .

Hailed as Ireland''s newest emerging star, and voted one of Ireland''s sexiest Irish men for two consecutive years, Kevin can be seen starring in the award winning RTE One TV drama "Raw" (2008). The show, now in its fourth season, is produced by Octagon Films.

In 2012, Kevin began filming on the highly anticipated BBC TV drama series "Copper" (2012), created by Oscar winning director Barry Levinson, multiple Emmy winner Tom Fontana and Academy Award nominee Will Rokos.

Drew McWeeny (born May 26, 1970), also known by his pseudonym Moriarty, is a film critic, screenwriter, and the former west coast editor of the Ain''t It Cool News website. In a December 2008 review of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, McWeeny announced that he would be leaving Ain''t It Cool News to work for HitFix.com.

He attended, but did not graduate from, Florida State University, instead choosing to focus on a career in entertainment in Los Angeles. He has two sons, Toshiro Lucas McWeeny, born in 2005 and Allen Miles McWeeny, born in 2008.

McWeeny was the subject of controversy in 1999 when a screenplay he had co-written was favorably reviewed by Harry Knowles on the website "Ain''t It Cool News". In reviewing the script, Knowles did not disclose that McWeeny was a regular contributor to the website under the name "Moriarty". Film Threat magazine would later accuse Knowles of lacking journalistic integrity. At the time McWeeny was working as a closed caption editor at VITAC.

McWeeny, along with partner Scott Swan, has since become a working television writer, writing two episodes in the Masters of Horror series, both directed by John Carpenter. The pair also co-wrote the episode "Skin and Bones" for the NBC horror/suspense anthology television series Fear Itself. In May 2008 it was announced that "Bat Out of Hell", a motion picture written by McWeeny and Swan, would be directed by Joe Dante. He also continues to work as a film critic, though he has been banned from Twentieth Century Fox press screenings.

At the age of ten, Sasha played "Bobby Walters" in the independent film, The Pirates of Central Park, a touching and imaginative story, based on the short story, "The Pirate of the Round Pond," by Lord Dunsany. Sasha was then cast in his theatrical film debut, still at the age of ten, in M. Night Shyamalan''s Unbreakable, starring Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis. Following closely was his role as the bewildered young "Hal Larson" in the Farrelly brother''s Shallow Hal, starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black. In the title role of "Zachary Beaver" in John Schultz''s When Zachary Beaver Came to Town, Neulinger shines in his sensitive portrayal of "the fattest boy in the world" alongside Jonathan Lipnicki and Eric Stoltz. Kids often recognize Sasha from his varied roles, from the young "Hal" to "Austin" ~ the title character in the wildly successful, multi Effie Award winning advertising campaign for Embassy Suites. When he is not working, Sasha attends the Lehigh Valley Charter High School for the Performing Arts in Bethlehem, PA. Sasha is a devoted fisherman and pursues both deep sea fishing expeditions and freshwater fishing in the lakes and streams of Pennsylvania, where he lives with his mother, sister and three dogs.

Ralph Nader (born February 27, 1934) is an American progressive political activist, and four-time candidate for President of the United States, having run as a Green Party candidate in 1996 and 2000, and as an independent candidate in 2004 and 2008. He is also an author, lecturer, and attorney.

Areas of particular concern to Nader include consumer protection, humanitarianism, environmentalism, and democratic government.

Nader came to prominence after publishing his book Unsafe At Any Speed, a critique of the safety record of the Chevrolet Corvair automobile. In 1999, an NYU panel of journalists ranked Unsafe At Any Speed 38th among the top 100 pieces of journalism of the 20th century.

In 1990, Life magazine named Nader one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century.

In 2006 The Atlantic Monthly, calling Nader one of the hundred most influential Americans in history, said, "He made the cars we drive safer; thirty years later, he made George W. Bush the president."

Prior to The Dog Whisperer series, Millan focused on rehabilitating especially aggressive dogs and founded the Dog Psychology Center in South Los Angeles (2002–2008) — under construction in a new Los Angeles location as of late 2009. Millan''s first three books, including Cesar''s Way, all became New York Times best sellers, have cumulatively sold two million copies in the United States and are available in 14 other countries.In 2009, in conjunction with IMG, Millan introduced a monthly magazine also titled Cesar''s Way — with the Wall Street Journal reporting at that time that half of American consumers recognized Millan. With Ilusión Millan, he founded the Cesar and Ilusión Millan Foundation — since re-named the Millan Foundation. He is working with Yale University to create a children''s curriculum based on his work. Millan''s most important tool in both his success with dogs and business has sometimes been attributed to a personal sense of balance, what The New York Times called "a sort of über-balanced mien."

Ashley Nicole Rickards (born May 4, 1992, height 5'' 3¾" (1,62 m)) is an American actress, known for her role in MTV''s Awkward as Jenna Hamilton, and as Samantha "Sam" Walker, a troubled young girl taken in by Brooke Davis who becomes her foster-mother, in The CW teen drama series One Tree Hill. She also starred in the 2011 independent drama film Fly Away as Mandy, a severely autistic girl.

Biography

Rickards grew up on a horse farm that catered for children with special needs. She attended a local Montessori school where, at age 13, she had her first taste of acting in an opera production. Rickards graduated from high school at age fifteen and is a member of Mensa. After attending a local talent showcase, organized by Lou Perlman, Rickards traveled to Los Angeles where she eventually gathered a team of representatives. Upon graduating, Rickards began to appear in a number of minor roles, as child labor laws restricted the number of hours she was able to work. After making a number of guest appearances and shorts, she landed the role of Samantha Walker, a runaway foster child, in One Tree Hill for the 2008-2009 season. Although not aware of the show before auditioning, Rickards found that she "learned so much from acting techniques to different ways of shooting things".Her character did not return the following season, while in the same year she had a bit part in her first feature film, Gamer.

Rickards spent much of 2009 attending auditions while a proposed lead-role in the film Dirty Girl fell through. In 2010 she appeared opposite Jimmy Smits in an episode of the legal drama Outlaw while she also auditioned for the lead-role in Awkward. Initially rejected, her manager Adam Griffin sent the producers a tape Rickards had made for Fly Away "to show how she can do anything". The actress landed both roles and filmed the pilot for the MTV series prior to Fly Away, a feature where she played a severely autistic girl.

A former competitive equestrian, she helped to launch the Project Futures Somaly Mam Foundation (2011), which works to prevent and end human trafficking and sexual slavery in Southeast Asia. Rickards writes poetry, scripts, and enjoys painting in her spare time. She also appeared in The Fray''s video for "How to Save a Life", and also in The Format''s video for "She Doesn''t Get It".', 'Sarasota, Florida, USA', 1, '/21s0lfhCx2hzjNzTFOwmkde665a.jpg'),

The band is named from the paper form issued by the UK government’s Department of Health and Social Security at the time of the band’s formation for claiming unemployment benefit (UB40 = Unemployment Benefit, Form 40).  UB40 were influenced by the many Blues Parties they attended as teenagers in the multiracial Balsall Heath area of Birmingham, their love of ska and reggae inspired such original tracks as King, Madam Medusa, Food For Thought, Signing Off and One In Ten.  Their early music style was unique, with a heavy influence of analogue synthesizers, psychedelic rock guitar, saxophone and dub producer techniques which were later perfected by the late Pablo Falconer.  Ali and Robin Campbell have a musical heritage, being sons of Ian Campbell, a folk musician.  The band purchased its first instruments with compensation money Ali Campbell received after a bar fight. They have had a number of hits, most commercially and to amusement of the band, “Red Red Wine”, a cover version of a Neil Diamond song (in an arrangement similar to that of Tony Tribe’s version). Their most successful single release is the cover of the Elvis Presley ballad Can’t Help Falling in Love which was intended to be the main title to the 1992 Sharon Stone movie Sliver and was a Number One hit across Europe and in the U.S.  Many of UB40’s recordings were inspired by 1960s ska and early lovers rock songs that would have otherwise been forgotten in the public eye.

Put simply, when it comes to driving a Formula One car, there are very few areas in which Hamilton does not excel.

Winning came naturally to the young driver and soon he was cutting his teeth in national events. By the age of 10 - with a little less than two years’ experience - he was crowned the youngest-ever winner of the British Cadet Kart championship.  Equipped with an assured racing style that belied his years, it wasn’t long before Hamilton’s trophy cabinet was groaning under the weight of more karting titles. Hamilton made sure that Ron Dennis was one of the first to notice his swift rise through the ranks and in 1998 the McLaren boss signed the Englishman to the team’s young driver programme.

After the commercial failure of their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), the band split up. In 2001, the group was reformed – with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up – and began a new, musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released four more albums, It Won''t Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012) and V (2014). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award.

Since 2011, Levine has served as a coach on NBC''s reality talent show The Voice. The winners of the first and fifth seasons, Javier Colon and Tessanne Chin, were on his team. In 2012, he made his acting debut as a recurring character in the horror television show American Horror Story: Asylum for the series'' second season. He also appeared in the film Begin Again.

As an entrepreneur, Levine launched his own eponymous fragrance line in 2013. The same year, he collaborated with Kmart and ShopYourWay.com to develop his menswear collection. He also owns a record label, 222 Records. In 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that "sources familiar with his many business dealings" estimated Levine would earn more than $35 million that year.

Ruth Clifford (February 17, 1900 – November 30, 1998) was an American actress of leading roles in silent films, whose career lasted from silent days into the television era.  Clifford got work as an extra and began her career at 15 at Universal, in fairly substantial roles. She received her first film credit for her work in Behind the Lines (1916).

By her mid-twenties, she was playing leads and second leads, including the role of Abraham Lincoln''s lost love, Ann Rutledge, in The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln (1924). But sound pictures found her roles diminishing, and throughout the next three decades she played smaller and smaller parts.

She was a favorite of director John Ford (they played bridge together), who used her in eight films, but rarely in substantial roles. She was also, for a time, the voice of Walt Disney''s Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck.

Clifford''s obituary in the Los Angeles Times noted that she "became a prime source for historians of the silent screen era".', 'Pawtucket, Rhode Island, USA', 1, '/x9ZQatovJK7KEh3Gzk5GjgcfDbw.jpg'),

Robert Dudley (September 13, 1869 – September 15*, 1955) was a dentist turned film character actor who, in his 35-year career, appeared in more than 115 films.

Dudley was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and was educated at Lake Forest College in Evanston, Illinois and Chicago, where he majored in oral surgery. In 1917 he appeared in his first film, Seven Keys to Baldpate, and then made three other silent films through 1921. After 1922 he worked consistently, appearing in three or four films a year, and making the transition to sound films in 1929 with The Bellamy Trial. Dudley often played characters with a quick temper, including jurors, shopkeepers, ticket agents, court clerks and justices of the peace, as well as an occasional farmer, hobo, or laborer. His performances in these small parts were frequently uncredited.

In the 1940s, Dudley was part of Preston Sturges'' unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in six films written and directed by Sturges. His most distinctive and memorable role for Sturges was the "Wienie King" in 1942''s The Palm Beach Story, the funny little self-made rich man with a big hat who spontaneously bankrolls Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea on their escapade.

The 5'' 9" Dudley, who was the founder of the "Troupers Club of Hollywood", was married to Elaine Anderson, and they had two girls, Jewell and Patricia Lee.

He made his final film, As Young as You Feel, in 1951, and died in 1955 in San Clemente, California.

She studied at the Royal Danish Ballet, but left in 1910 to pursue a career as a stage actress. During the World War I years, she performed at Det Ny Teater in the capital city of Copenhagen. During the early 1920s, she was engaged at the Royal Danish Theatre for four seasons by request of theater director Johannes Poulsen. From 1927 to 1940 she was engaged at several theaters throughout Denmark and often left the theater to live abroad. In the early 1940s she was engaged at the Frederiksberg Theatre under direction of Svend Melsing and then the Allé-Scenen Theatre under direction of Svend Rindom. From the mid-1940s she rarely appeared on stage, but occasionally performed in radio theater.

Astrid Holm made her screen debut for Dansk Filmfabrik in 1917''s Søstrene Morelli (The Sisters Morelli) and the following year was under contract to Nordisk Film. Her first film for Nordisk was a role in the 1918 Holger-Madsen-directed Folkets Ven (The People''s Friend), opposite Gunnar Tolnæs and Svend Kornbeck. This was followed by several popular films for Emanuel Gregers. One of her most popular roles was as Sister Edith in the 1921 Victor Sjöström-directed Swedish silent Körkarlen (The Phantom Carriage). The film was based on the 1912 novel Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness! by Nobel prize-winning Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. In 1925 she starred opposite Johannes Meyer in the Carl Theodor Dreyer-directed drama Du skal ære din hustru (Thou Shalt Honor Thy Wife). This would be Holm''s last film role for many years.

Astrid Holm returned to film in 1942''s Ta'' briller på, directed by Arne Weel and starring Liva Weel and Hans Egede Budtz. She would appear in four more films throughout the 1940s before retiring from the screen due to failing health. Her final film appearance would be in the 1947 Holger Gabrielsen-directed Mani.

Astrid Holm was married to ballet dancer Holger Holm, who died in 1916. During the 1950s, she became reclusive, suffering from a number of ailments. She died in 1961 at age 68.', 'Denmark', 1, NULL),

While in Vancouver Stefano appeared in a supporting role on Cold Squad as Manuel Diaz, a man suspected of killing his girlfriend. He also quickly found himself in the pilot for the hit T.V series Stargate Atlantis, as Toran, opposite (Rachel Luttrel), and again in The Lizzie McGuire Movie (Hilary Duff), and The Chronicles Riddick (Vin Diesel).

Stefano DiMatteo recently completed a co-starring role in the upcoming horror film, Survival of the Dead, the latest installment in George A. Romero''s, (Night of the Living Dead) of the Dead series, in which he stars as National Guardsman running around Plum Island, off the Atlantic Coast trying to keep the Dead, dead, opposite Alan Van Sprang (The Tudors), Devon Bostick (Adoration), and Kenneth Welsh (Adoration). Recently the film had its world premiere at the 66th Venice Film Festival, where DiMatteo can be seen standing beside George A. Romero on the Red Carpet promoting the film to rabid fans.

Upon finishing shooting of Survival of the Dead, the up-and coming actor went directly back to work in a supporting role, opposite Judd Nelson (The Breakfast Club) on the highly anticipated sequel to Troy Duffy''s original cult favorite Boondocks Saints. Boondocks Saints: All Saints Day, is set for theatrical release in November 2009, where Judd Nelson playing Concezio Yakavetta, the new Don of Don''s and DiMatteo playing his Capo, plot and scheme on how best to deal with the resurgence of the Saints. There will be guns, big guns!

Stefano has also shared the screen with Matt Lanter (Beverly Hills 90210), in a co-starring role in the third installment of the Cutting Edge Trilogy, Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream. DiMatteo plays, Lanter''s, ambitious coach who covets the Olympic gold medal almost more than the two he is training to win it. The Cutting Edge, was initially made famous, by D.B.Sweeny (Eight Men Out), and Moira Kelly (Chaplin), in 1992, and it would appear as though its lasting effect has found a home among a new generation of fans with the resurgence of the Cutting Edge Films. Look for in now in video stores.

Stefano is working on Crash &amp; Burn, a new T.V. series created by Whizbang Productions (Paul Gross), slated to air on Showcase in January 2010, where he has a recurring role as the character Arlindo.

In 2008 Stefano DiMatteo''s directorial debut, Communication Breakdown, a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of dating in the 21st century, had its world premiere at the Canadian Film Festival, followed by a screening at the prestigious Maui Film Festival and eventually winning him a Best Short Film award at the MIFF Festival.

Ivan Sen is an Australian filmmaker. Throughout the late 1990s Sen worked on numerous short films, before making his feature film debut with Beneath Clouds in 2002. He studied filmmaking at the Australian Film Television and Radio School, where he produced his first short films, working with the crew he continues to work with today. Sen was raised in Inverell, New South Wales, Australia.

Sen drew on his own background as the child of an Aboriginal mother and an absent white father for the screenplay of his first feature-length work, Beneath Clouds, filmed on a $2.5 million dollar budget. The film follows two teenagers, Lena (Dannielle Hall) and Vaughn (Damian Pitt) who are hitchhiking their way from a rural New South Wales town to Sydney, each for different reasons. The film explores many of the racial difficulties in their society as well as the way the choices each makes can effect how they turn out. The film was based on Ivan Sen''s own experiences of growing up in Alice Springs with an Aboriginal mother and absent European father. It won Sen global acclaim, screening at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and winning the Premiere First Movie Award at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival and the 2002 Best Director Award at the Australian Film Institute Awards.

In 2009, the Message Sticks Indigenous Film Festival held at the Sydney Opera House saw the world premiere of Sen''s Fire Talker, a documentary biopic about political activist, Aboriginal footballer, Charlie Perkins. It premiered at the 10th Anniversary of the Message Sticks Indigenous Film Festival held at the Sydney Opera House in May 2009.

Sen''s second feature-length film, Dreamland, screened at the 2010 Melbourne International Film Festival.

He immediately began working in commercials but also focused on his love of martial arts, which resulted in him becoming the 2006 ATA Tae Kwon Do California State Champion in all categories, including sparring and extreme weapons. Having accomplished his goal Uriah returned his full attention to acting, where he began working on TV shows, including Without a Trace, The Ghost Whisperer, Mad TV, Dirty Sexy Money, The Suite Life, Monk, Trust Me, Trauma, Hallmark''s The Nanny Express, and the independent feature Alabama Moon.

When he was three years old, he witnessed his abusive father point a gun at his mom during an episode of domestic violence. Along with his mother and younger brother Carl, they left their father in search of a better life.

At the age of seven, with money hard to come by and with little food to put on the table, Zyrus urged his mother to teach him how to sing and let him join singing contests to help support their family. He went around the provinces of Laguna and Batangas, joining amateur singing contests in town fiestas and later, on little-known shows on television. He started winning most of the contests he joined, often borrowing money from friends and neighbors for the bus fare then paying them back after he had won. He estimates he joined 80-100 singing contests all in all.

In May 2008, Zyrus was invited to guest on Oprah, for a themed show called World''s Smartest Kids. She sang I Have Nothing by Whitney Houston and bought the audience to their feet, giving him another standing ovation. No one was more impressed than Oprah Winfrey herself though, incredulously asking him, "Girl, that was fantastic! Who are you?!" The next day, Charice and his mother were already on a plane waiting to take off for the Philippines when Oprah called to stop the plane and bring them back to her office. Oprah had been so impressed with the child and couldn''t get him off her mind. He listened to Zyrus'' story and told him, "Don''t lose hope. I promise you something big will happen." She then called legendary music producer David Foster who took Zyrus on under his wing.

Zyrus, as David Foster''s protégé, suddenly found himself singing duets with Andrea Bocelli in Italy and with his idol Celine Dion in Madison Square Garden. He also shared the stage with other big names such as Michael Buble and Josh Groban. He performed at three of President Barack Obama''s pre-inauguration galas and made a cameo appearance as himself in 2009''s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel. He also went on to appear on the Oprah show three more times after his initial appearance, the most recent one being last May 11, 2010, a day after his 18th birthday, to debut his international album CHARICE.

Lucien Leon Laviscount (born 9 June 1992) is a British actor and recording artist best known for his portrayal of Jonah Kirby on popular BBC One drama Waterloo Road.

He first came to prominence in 2007 after starring in teen dramedy Grange Hill. In 2009, Laviscount had a recurring role on iconic British soap opera Coronation Street as Ben Richardson. In 2011, he competed in the rebooted series of Celebrity Big Brother, where he became involved in a love triangle with Amy Childs and Kerry Katona.

In 2012, he made the transition to recording artist with the release of his debut single "Dance With You". He was set to play the lead in the potential series Supernatural: Bloodlines, a spin-off to the CW show Supernatural, which did not get picked up. In 2015, he played a regular character, Earl Grey, in the first season of the horror comedy Scream Queens on FOX.', 'Burnley, Lancashire, England, UK', 1, '/lQLjddaMXpAPYQ9hxWDYE1GwG6D.jpg'),
        (233117, 'William Stack', '1882-03-05', 'William Stack has been often mistaken as British in the scant bio  information available on him - he could imitate many a British accent.  He was actually born in Oregon. But like many Americans who wished to  become serious stage actors and seeing New York as overly competitive,  he went to London as a young man. Not much is known about his career  there, but with many theaters (almost fifty) and companies around, the  opportunities for a talented young man were there. From the craze for  post cards with the subject of photos - and especially those of actors  that ensued between about 1890 and 1914, there exist pictures of  Stack  as Hamlet. So Stack did find initial success, and by 1918 he tried his  hand in the budding British silent film industry with not much initial  interest - just one film that year and another in 1922, then back to the  stage.

But by 1930 Stack was back in America - and not to  Broadway (perhaps in a touring company, but at least not on record as a  principal), as was a stage actor''s usual course. He did end up in early  Hollywood sound pictures - those with marginal sound quality - first  with Fredric March  as the star in Sarah and Son  (1930). With a rich stage actor''s voice and accents to apply where  needed - and appreciated as audio technology improved - he appeared in  from four to ramping up to as many as ten pictures per year through the  1930s. Moving into his 50s, bald and dignified, his roles were focused  as featured character pieces - assured doctors, lawyers, judges, nobles,  and several butlers. He was one of the Crawley clan in Becky Sharp  (1935), the first feature-length three-color film. He perhaps gained  press from being in one movie of some scandalous notoriety - Tarzan and His Mate (1934) in which Maureen O''Sullivan  appeared to swim nude (somebody else in a body stocking). Although he  had a few lines as a white hunter, in this and other films (of note,  MGM''s first and most famous version of Mutiny on the Bounty, 1935),  Stack was not credited for his always believable characterizations.

The  year 1936 provided Stack with some his most memorable historical roles.  He played the French general Montcalm of the French and Indian War in  the popular The Last of the Mohicans  (1936) with Randolph Scott. The same year he played a much richer character in the film adaptation of the play Mary of Scotland (1936) directed by John Ford.  Along with an assemblage of some of the best character actors of  Hollywood, Stack played one among a rogues'' gallery of self-seeking  Scottish lords who included: Robert Barrat, Gavin Muir (another American who spent time in England and was often thought to be British), and Ian Keith.  Stack is able to be most Shakespearean, vying in Scottish brogue with  his fellow conspirators as the sly Lord Ruthven. Although Stack appeared  in many of the best A pictures of the later 1930s, many did not give  credit for his great acting skills. There were only a few movies into  the 1940s, before he retired - leaving film history all the richer for  his screen presence.', 'Baker, Oregon, USA', 1, NULL),

Gabriella Licudi (born September 14, 1941, Casablanca, Morocco) is a Moroccan-born British former actress.

Born in Casablanca while her father, a Greek naval engineer, was stationed there, Gabriella Licudi was educated in England, France and Spain before settling permanently in England at the age of fifteen. Initially planning to teach elocution, she studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama, where she was spotted by an agent while performing in a class production in 1961. Her first major role on stage was John Mortimer''s Two Stars for Comfort, starring Trevor Howard which ran for nine months in London''s West End. Film producer Samuel Bronston attended a performance and offered her a small role in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964).

Other roles included as a widowed expatriate opposite Patrick McGoohan in the 1965 episode of Danger Man titled "English Lady Takes Lodgers". Licudi also had appeared in the James Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967) opposite Deborah Kerr, the Henry Hathaway film The Last Safari (1967), and a lead role in Don Levy''s experimental feature Herostratus (1967).

Gabriella Licudi made her last film appearances in the early 1970s. She and her South African husband ran a safari lodge for several years before she eventually returned to London to run her own production company.

Elle entame après son bac des études de théâtre qui lui permettent de connaître une carrière cinématographique en tant qu’actrice, réalisatrice et scénariste. Elle épouse en premières noces Jean-Noël Fenwick et en secondes noces Jean-Marc Piaton. Trois filles sont issues de cette seconde union :Julia (1985), Clara (1988) et Johanna (1991). C''est Coluche qui lui offre son premier vrai rôle au cinéma dans le Maître d''école de Claude Berri en 1981. Les Sous-doués en vacances puis Chouans ! en font un second rôle populaire. Son premier vrai rôle principal, elle se l''offre en adaptant son spectacle Une journée chez ma mère au cinéma. En 1999, elle passe à la réalisation avec la comédie Mon père, ma mère, mes frères et mes sœurs... qui obtient un joli succès. Dans les années 2000, elle tourne surtout des téléfilms (Un été de canicule, Un amour à taire, Clara Sheller) et la série Madame le Proviseur. Durant les années 1980 et 90, elle est l''une des sociétaires des Grosses Têtes de Philippe Bouvard. Elle participe aussi à l''émission de Laurent Ruquier, On va s''gêner, sur Europe 1. Elle est l''invitée et la protagoniste de l''émission Rendez-vous en terre inconnue chez les Nénètses en Sibérie diffusée sur France 2 en 2007, animée par Frédéric Lopez. Le 31 décembre 2009, Charlotte de Turckheim a joué son dernier spectacle à Nijrab, en Afghanistan, pour fêter la bonne année aux soldats engagés en Afghanistan et les soutenir . L’humoriste a fait son one woman show devant quelques-uns des 3 300 soldats français déployés sur le sol afghan.

Everyone would ask how it''s done beforehand so I''d put them out of their misery and thread my old chap through the handles of the glasses". The son of a London cab driver, Bindon was sentenced to Borstal twice in his youth and gained his nickname ''Biffo'' from his propensity for starting fights. Spotted by Ken Loach in a London pub, Bindon got his acting break with the 1967 film Poor Cow. Roles in classic British films like Performance, Get Carter and Quadrophenia would follow, with Bindon often typecast as a gangland heavy. In 1968, Bindon met Vicki Hodge, a baronet''s daughter turned model and actress, who introduced him to British aristocracy. This led to close and controversial links with Princess Margaret and her holiday hideaway of the Caribbean island resort of Mustique. Bindon and his alleged relationship with Princess Margaret is a major plot element in the 2008 crime film The Bank Job.  Also in 1968, Bindon was awarded the Queen''s Award for Bravery for diving off Putney Bridge into the River Thames to rescue a drowning man - although some said he had pushed the man in and only rescued him when a policeman appeared. In 1979, Bindon stood trial for the murder of London gangster John Darke. Bindon''s successful defence (bolstered by a character witness appearance from actor Bob Hoskins) argued that Darke''s death was in self-defence, saying Bindon was in fear of his life as he was being blackmailed about losing drug money and cocaine worth thousands of pounds. Despite being acquitted, Bindon struggled to find work in the entertainment industry as his reputation was now tarnished. He died of an AIDS-related illness in 1993, having spent the later years of his life as a virtual recluse in Belgravia.', 'London, England, UK', 1, '/rkVReppiyYlncdpU9QMp664rmZu.jpg'),

For his role in ''Neverlost", Ry lost 50lbs to better suit the character, and is known for his dedication and physical commitment to each and every role he takes on. He has played a variety of roles demonstrating his dynamic range as an actor, from an optimistic but vulnerable jock in the thriller, ''I Choose Chaos'' ; the iconic Stephen King character, Ace Merrill in the adaptation ''Love Never Dies'', a talking newlywed zombie in the zombie comedy ''The Post-Lifers'', to a disconnected rebel fighting zombies in Reese Eveneshen''s ''Dead Genesis'', and a man haunted by his past in the supernatural thriller ''Kingdom Come'', to name a few. A born lover of cinema, long-time short story and song lyric writer, Barrett''s interests quickly branched into screen-writing and producing. In summer of 2008, Barrett again teamed with director and friend Gabriel Carrer. He developed, wrote, produced and starred in the indie horror success ''If A Tree Falls'', which premiered summer 2010 at the Fantasia Int. Film Festival and was released internationally in various formats. Barrett wrote the script to reflect present day sensibilities relevant to the standards of today''s psychological thrillers and horror films, but to be executed in a style and tone of exploitation classics of the past.

No sooner than arriving, Autumn’s involvement in the arts began.  Modeling, ballet, tap, jazz, modern dance and gymnastics filled her evenings after school and her love of equestrian riding took over on the weekends.  At 16 years old she choreographed her first lyrical routine with the team winning first place.  Her dynamic dance technique and choreography won her a place on several companies and afforded her the ability to travel extensively throughout the US, Europe and Asia. 

Autumn’s prominent features landed her several national print campaigns and magazine covers only to discover that her success in modeling was just the beginning.  At 18 years of age, after booking several regional and national commercials, the acting bug bit her. Since then she has dedicated herself to the art, studying with Richard Brander, Harvery Lembeck Comedy Workshop, Divisek, and most recently with Shanelle and David Gray at Gray Studios.

Autumn has appeared in projects with Kellan Lutz, Peter Weller, Joe Anderson, Brock Cuchna, Jane Seymour, and Billy Zane. Last year Autumn was involved in projects that were screened at Queen''s Int''l Film Festival, Bev Hills Hi-Def Festival, Mammoth Film Festival, Sacramento Film Festival, and Honest Thieves Film Festival. The year started out in the UK filming the feature film "Flutter" in which she plays "Nancy", Billy Zane''s Wife who is a Dental Nurse. The next project took her to New Orleans for Dermot Mulroney''s Directorial debut in "Love, Wedding, Marriage". Autumn''s short film "Ugly" was nominated Best Short at the Burbank International Film Festival.

Robert Arden (11 December 1922 – 25 March 2004) was an American film, television and radio actor born in London who worked and lived mostly in the United Kingdom.

Arden was born from an American father and an English mother. His father had a successful career as a professional boxer after World War I. He attended "a combination of English and American schools."

Arden''s most famous film appearance was as lead character Guy Van Stratten in Mr. Arkadin (1955), written and directed by Orson Welles. Welles had worked with Arden on the Harry Lime radio series, produced in London, and later cast the little-known actor in Mr. Arkadin, in the central role of the investigator who uncovers Arkadin''s past. Reportedly, Arden was shocked that Welles might consider him for the part and initially thought that the director''s phone inquiry was a crank call.

Arden''s performance in Mr. Arkadin was panned by some critics : The New York Times called it "hopelessly inadequate". Film historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has defended Arden''s performance, locating the problem not in the actor''s work but in "the unsavoriness and obnoxiousness of the character", who was intended by Welles to be unattractive even though he occupied in the film "the space normally reserved for charismatic heroes".

The credits of one the film''s Spanish versions misspelled Arden''s name as "Bob Harden". Another Spanish print actually credited him as "Mark Sharpe".

Mr. Arkadin did poorly at the box-office. Afterwards, Arden played a few other lead roles, in films such as The Depraved (1957) or The Child and the Killer (1959), but he worked mostly as a character actor, appearing in film, television and stage productions. he worked mostly as a character actor, appearing in film, television and stage productions.', 'London, England, UK', 1, '/l8lx4yA8IQtgxPsd47p9dnoPWgQ.jpg'),

De 1962 à 1965, il suit les cours du Centre dramatique de l''Est alors sous la direction d''Hubert Gignoux, Paul Lefèvre et Claude Petitpierre. Parallèlement, il continue l''étude de l''orgue, du clavecin et du piano. Après les deux années de son service militaire (1965-1967) pendant lesquelles il apprend l''allemand, il devient membre de la maison de la Culture deBourges, dirigée par Gabriel Monnet. En 1971, il participe aux débuts du Théâtre de l''Espérance avec Jean Jourdheuil etJean-Pierre Vincent, puis, en 1976, rejoint l’école du TNS (l''école supérieure d’art dramatique de Strasbourg) que dirige le même Jean-Pierre Vincent. De 1985 à 1987, il est pensionnaire à la Comédie-Française. Philippe Clévenot joue aussi bien le répertoire classique que le théâtre contemporain. Ainsi le voit-on dans Le Misanthropede Molière ou Macbeth de Shakespeare (deux mises en scène de Jean-Pierre Vincent) ; dans Le Prince de Hombourg deKleist (mise en scène de Matthias Langhoff), La Cruche cassée du même Kleist (mise en scène de Bernard Sobel) ; dansL''École des femmes de Molière (mise en scène de Bernard Sobel), Le Neveu de Rameau de Diderot (mise en scène de Jean-Marie Simon), dans Artaud Mômo ou la conférence du Vieux Colombier et Histoire vécue d''Artaud Mômo d''Antonin Artaud, où il interprète l''auteur, dans Un barrage contre le Pacifique de Marguerite Duras ou encore Dans la jungle des villesde Brecht (mise en scène de Stéphane Braunschweig), dans la Vie de l’égoïste Fätzer, du même Brecht (sous la direction de Bernard Sobel), dans Rumeur à Wall Street de Bernard Chatellier, d’après le Bartleby de Melville (mise en scène deBérangère Bonvoisin), ou bien Pionniers à Ingolstadt de Marieluise Fleisser. En tant que metteur en scène, on lui doit notamment Anna Christie d’Eugene O''Neill, à Genève, en 2000 — spectacle qui est repris au Théâtre Gérard Philipe, à Villeurbanne, en 2001. Par ailleurs, il a également écrit Celle qui ment, d''après la célèbre mystique italienne Angèle de Foligno. Son premier rôle au cinéma lui est offert par René Allio en 1970, dans Les Camisards. Il travaille ensuite avec de nombreux cinéastes, dont Bertrand Blier, Patrice Leconte ou encore Jean-Jacques Beineix. L’un de ses derniers films au cinéma estDisparus (1998), premier long métrage historique et politique d''un jeune réalisateur, Gilles Bourdos. Ayant toujours partagé son temps entre Paris et la Normandie, avec sa compagne la comédienne Bérangère Bonvoisin, Philippe Clévenot meurt à l’âge de cinquante-neuf ans, le 18 octobre 2001, des suites d’une longue maladie.

Ralph has written two screenplays that were made into films, "The Planet of the Dinosaurs" and the thriller, "The Child."  Most recently, he has written the libretto for the musical version of "Little Women" which is slated to open on Broadway next year.

One of Ralph’s goals is, "to bring some class to gay theatre and films." His solution is to write an intellectual gay porno film - Emile Zola Goes Leather.

Vicki Gene Robinson  (born May 29, 1947 in Fayette County, Kentucky) is the ninth bishop of the Diocese of New Hampshire in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.  Robinson was elected bishop in 2003 and entered office in March 2004. Before becoming bishop, he served as assistant to the retiring New Hampshire bishop.

Robinson is widely known for being the first openly gay, non-celibate priest to be ordained a bishop in a major Christian denomination believing in the historic episcopate. His sexual orientation was privately acknowledged in the 1970s, when he studied in seminary, was ordained, married, and started a family. He went public with his sexual identity and divorced in the 1980s. When delegates to the Episcopal convention were voting on the ratification of his election, it became an issue of controversy. His election was ratified 62 to 45. After his election, some theologically conservative parishes have aligned themselves with bishops outside the Episcopal Church in the United States, a process called the Anglican realignment. His story has appeared in print and film.

In 2009 he was given the Stephen F. Kolzak Media Award. He has announced his intention to retire in 2013, at 65.

Jean Clottes is a prominent French prehistorian. He was born in the French Pyrénées in 1933 and began to study archaeology in 1959, while teaching high school. He initially focused on Neolithic dolmens, which were the topic of his 1975 Ph.D. thesis at the University of Toulouse. After being appointed director of prehistoric antiquities for the Midi-Pyrénées in 1971, he began to study prehistoric cave art in order to fulfill the responsibilities of that position. In the following years he led a series of excavations of prehistoric sites in the region. In 1992, he was named General Inspector for Archaeology at the French Ministry of Culture; in 1993 he was appointed Scientific Advisor for prehistoric rock art at the French Ministry of Culture. He formally retired in 1999, but remains an active contributor to the field.

To date he has written over 300 scientific papers, and has edited, co-edited, written, or co-authored a total of over 20 books. He has also lectured around the world, taught at the University of Toulouse and the University of California at Berkeley, and engaged in numerous public outreach and professional service activities.[1][2] He has received several honors from the French government and also from the Blue Tuareg people of the Sahara Desert, who made him an honorary Tuareg in 2007.

He also anchored the school''s morning television show, and produced commercials and short videos for the students.  A graduate of Towson University''s Electronic Media and Film department, he began his feature film career in 2000 with "Makebelieve" at the age of 21. His follow up, "Still Life" (2001) was an award winning digital feature shot in and around Baltimore.  Flanagan then produced television programming for Discovery and ESPN in 2002, and in 2003 wrote and directed the award-winning feature film "Ghosts of Hamilton Street". Later that year, Mike was the Director of Photography for the cult hit "Chainsaw Sally" by Writer/Director Jimmy O Burril.  Mike moved from Baltimore to Los Angeles the day after "Chainsaw Sally" wrapped, and almost immediately found work directing &amp; editing "The Gleib Show" for National Lampoon Networks and several reality television programs, as well as regional commercials.  In 2005, Flanagan turned to the horror genre for the first time with "Oculus", an applauded short film that is just the beginning of an ambitious horror anthology.

Gene Baur (formerly Gene Bauston) is an activist, best-selling author, and president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, the first animal rescue organization dedicated to farmed animals. He is vegan and has been at the forefront of animal rights since he began the Sanctuary in 1986.

Baur grew up in Hollywood, California, and went to Loyola High School (Los Angeles). He attended Cal State Northridge where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in Sociology. He paid for college in part by doing background work in television and movies, including commercials for McDonalds and KFC, about which he later expressed regret. During high school and college, he had various jobs, including dishwasher, day laborer, bartender, and teacher, and he volunteered to help children suffering from terminal illnesses as well as abused adolescents. He also participated in the efforts of human rights, animal rights, consumer and environmental organizations. In the 1980s he began investigations into factory farms, stockyards, and slaughterhouses. Baur felt the conditions he observed were unacceptable, and these experiences helped motivate the creation of Farm Sanctuary. The sanctuary''s first rescued animal was a downed sheep found on a pile of dead animals behind Lancaster stockyards in 1986.

Baur''s investigative exposés and advocacy efforts on behalf of farm animals have earned international media coverage, including ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, the Los Angeles Times, and the New York Times. TIME called Baur, "the conscience of the food movement."

Baur later obtained a Master''s degree in agricultural economics from Cornell University, in order to better understand factory farming. He has testified before local, state and federal legislative bodies, and appeared on various expert panels. In 1996, The Peace Abbey awarded Baur with its Courage of Conscience Award, other recipients of which include Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, Ram Dass, and Pete Seeger.

He played a key role in the passage of several animal-protection ordinances, including a 2004 California law banning the production and sale of foie gras,[8] and a 2002 Florida initiative banning gestation crates. After the Florida campaign the Florida Elections Commission found that Farm Sanctuary, and Gene Bauston personally, had willfully broken campaign finance laws. Farm Sanctuary and Gene Baur consented to pay a fine of $50,000. More recently, he was instrumental in passing a 2006 (repealed in 2008) Chicago ordinance banning the sale of foie gras[ and a 2006 ballot measure in Arizona banning gestation crates and veal crates. Gene and Farm Sanctuary were key sponsors of a California initiative (Proposition 2) to ban veal crates, gestation crates and battery cages which passed on November 4, 2008, when it was approved with over 63% of the vote.

Baur was one of several people who provided information used in the writing of the book Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism (2008) by Mark Hawthorne.

In March 2008, Baur released a book entitled Farm Sanctuary: Changing Hearts and Minds About Animals and Food published by Simon &amp; Schuster. It has appeared on the Los Angeles Times and Boston Globe bestseller lists and was named to Booklist''s Top 10 Sci-Tech Books: 2008.

He appears in a documentary film called Peaceable Kingdom, that was made about Farm Sanctuary and people who work or visit there (especially Gene Baur and Lorri Houston, his ex-wife).

Victor Rebengiuc (known in full as Victor-George Rebengiuc; born February 10, 1933) is an award-winning Romanian film and stage actor, also known as a civil society activist. Since 1957, he has been a member of the Bulandra Theater company, acting in more than 200 roles on that stage alone. Having had his breakthrough performance with Liviu Ciulei''s The Forest of the Hanged, Rebengiuc became a major figure in Romanian cinema, and became especially known for his 1986 appearance in Stere Gulea''s Moromeţii. He also starred in films by Dan Piţa (Tănase Scatiu; Dreptate în lanţuri; Faleze de nisip; The Man of the Day) and Lucian Pintilie (De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?; Balanţa; Too Late; Last Stop Paradise; Niki and Flo; Tertium non datur). Rebengiuc was celebrated for his stage performances, appearing in plays directed by, among others, Ciulei, Radu Penciulescu, Andrei Şerban, Cătălina Buzoianu, Yuri Kordonsky, Gábor Tompa and Alexandru Dabija. The former husband of actress Anca Vereşti, he is married to Mariana Mihuţ, his Bulandra colleague.

Rebengiuc''s life under the communist regime provided him an anti-communist perspective, and some of his 1980s films were censored or banned by the country''s officials. In 1989, he took part in the Romanian Revolution, when he was among the people who stormed into the Romanian Television building and broadcast the downfall of Nicolae Ceauşescu and an end to communist rule. Rebengiuc subsequently spoke out against political forces he believes stand for the regime''s legacy in modern society, and called for the retrospective condemnation of communism. As a public figure, he has had a brief career in politics, and, since the mid-1990s, endorses non-governmental organizations.

Moazzam Begg  (born in 1968 in Sparkhill, Birmingham, England), is a British Pakistani Muslim who was held in extrajudicial detention in the Bagram Theater Internment Facility and the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp, in Cuba, by the U.S. government for nearly three years.  The Pentagon claimed Begg was an enemy combatant and al-Qaeda member, recruited others for al-Qaeda, provided money and support to al-Qaeda training camps, received extensive military training in al-Qaeda-run terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and prepared to fight U.S. or allied troops.  While Begg admits spending time at two Islamic militant training camps in Afghanistan, supporting militant Muslim fighters, buying a rifle and a handgun, that he "thought about" taking up arms in Chechnya, and being an acquaintance of people linked to terrorism (most notably, Khalil al-Deek, Dhiren Barot, and Shahid Akram Butt), he denies the remainder of the U.S.''s allegations.

Begg says that when he was incarcerated at Bagram, though not in Guantanamo Bay to which he was later moved, he was hog-tied, kicked, punched, and left in a room with a bag put over his head, even though he suffered from asthma. A Pentagon spokesman said there was "no credible evidence that Begg was ever abused by U.S. forces". Begg has also spoken of having witnessed two other detainees being beaten to death while detained at Bagram. Officials concluded the men were murdered and an investigation was conducted.  After intensive discussions with the U.K. government, President Bush had him released without charge on 25 January 2005. Bush released Begg over the objections of the Pentagon, the CIA, and the FBI, who were concerned that Begg could still be a dangerous terrorist.  In November 2010, the British Government announced that it had reached a financial settlement out of court with a number of individuals, including Begg, who accused British officials of complicity in their alleged abuse and torture while in the custody of the United States.

After his release, he became a commentator on radio and television on issues pertaining to the UK Muslim community and UK and worldwide anti-terror measures, and toured as a speaker about his time in Guantanamo and other detention facilities. Referring to 2010 Afghanistan, he said he completely supported the inalienable right of the people to fight "foreign occupation".  He has also co-authored a book, and authored broadsheet and magazine pieces.  In 2010, Gita Sahgal, then the head of Amnesty International''s gender unit, publicly condemned her organization for its collaboration with Begg, calling it "a gross error of judgment".

Daughter of Japanese immigrants, Yamasaki was one of the first women filmmakers in Brazil to achieve a successful and longstanding career. She and her peers learned filmmaking by working on the sets of well-established Cinema Novo directors such as Glauber Rocha and Nelson Pereira dos Santos.

Yamasaki challenged the norms of Cinema Novo by increasing both the representation of women and the awareness of issues affecting women in Brazilian society. Her film style focuses on historical subjects and she uses the genre of melodrama to reconstruct Brazilian politics, history and culture.

She established herself as one of the most important film directors of the 1980s. Her films discussed sexuality and traditional gender roles more openly within Brazilian cultural identity. Yamasaki initiated a “cinema of emotion” to comment on Brazil’s past and rework female figures’ experiences in Brazil’s history.

During her career, especially during the final years of the Brazilian military dictatorship, Yamasaki has suffered censorship and funding issues with her films. In response to these challenges, she established her own production company in 1976, Centro de Produção e Comunicação (Production and Communication Center).

Tizuka gained some critical acclaim with her 1980 film "Gaijin, Os Caminhos da Liberdade" (aka "Gaijin, a Brazilian Odyssey"), a story about Japanese immigration to Brazil. She has also achieved the audience''s praise by directing movies starring children TV show hostess Xuxa, which have become extremely popular and a cornerstone in Brazilian pop culture.

        (562179, 'Brent Corrigan', '1986-10-31', 'Sean Paul Lockhart is an American actor and director.  Lockhart''s acting career started in gay pornographic films, using the stage name of Brent Corrigan. He appeared in his first film "Every Poolboy''s Dream" (2004) when he was only 17 and featured in another seven films for Cobra Video.

He has been at the center of two major controversies. The first was when he disclosed that he had been underage in his first pornographic video. This led to a second, in which Bryan Phillips (aka Bryan Charles Kocis), of Cobra Video, laid a claim to the screen name "Brent Corrigan", effectively stating that Lockhart would not be able to work in the adult industry under his established screen name and therefore might have difficulty finding work at all.  When Lockhart launched a website, BrentCorriganOnline.com, Phillips sued him for copyright infringement, cyber-squatting, and breach of contract for using his screen name. This lawsuit was to go before a judge in February of 2007. Before that, however, Lockhart met two other producers, Harlow Cuadra and Joseph Kerekes of Falcon Films, who expressed interest in working with him, but knew that would be difficult with Phillips staking a claim on his name. In January of 2007, Phillips was found stabbed 28 times, with his throat cut and nearly decapitated. His home was also set on fire to conceal evidence. Cuadra and Kerekes appear to have killed Phillips to get Lockhart out of his contract and legally able to work for other producers under the name "Brent Corrigan". Though his involvement, however indirectly, in a murder could have damaged his career, it has not. Lockhart was never accused of conspiring with Cuadra and Kerekes, and no evidence of such a claim has ever surfaced. Furthermore, when it became clear that he may have been a motivating factor, Lockhart cooperated fully with authorities in helping them find their suspects. Cuadra and Kerekes were both given life sentences.

Lockhart has successfully moved on with his career, having established his own web site, continuing to work in adult films, appearing in some gay-themes mainstream films, and making PSAs for safe sex.

Over his nearly 40-year career, he has made over 200 films of varying length. He made his first film, Interim (1952) at age 18 after dropping out of college. Brakhage films seek to change the way we see. They encourage viewers to eschew traditional narrative structure in favor of pure visual perception that is not reliant on naming what is seen; rather his goal is to create a more visceral visual experience, for he believes that a "stream-of visual-consciousness could be nothing less than the pathway of the soul." To this end, his films are shot in highly sensual colors and utilize minimal soundtracks.

His work can be divided into distinct periods. His first short films explored the properties and possibilities of light. In many of his experimental ventures, Brakhage has forgone traditional cinematography in favor of working directly with the film stock itself. He has occasionally painted, inked, scratched and dyed images onto it; he has also tried pasting organic objects on the film. His most famous example is the 1963 short Mothlight in which he glued moth wings onto the stock. Some of his early films were based on his most intimate experiences that included making love to his new bride--depicted on negative film--in Wedlock House: An Intercourse (1959), and an attempt to bring his dead dog back to life with a camera in Sirius Remembered (1959). During the 1960s, Brakhage''s iconoclastic views were celebrated for their poetry, but during the ''70s, his focus changed to social issues and he alienated many supporters with such disturbing film series as the "Pittsburgh documents" in which he presented many gruesome views of inner city life with films such as Act of Seeing with One''s Own Eyes (1971) which was shot in a morgue. He also continued with autobiographical material with the "Sincerity/Duplicity series. During the 1980s, Brakhage''s focus again changed--this time he became intrigued with creating truly "abstract" films such as Arabics (1982) which consists of brilliant bursts of colored light which he claims, represent "envisioned music." In addition to filmmaking, Brakhage also wrote books about films and filmmaking and also served as a teacher.', 'Kansas City, Missouri, USA', 1, '/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg'),

A Frenchman who also worked in the United Kingdom and the United States, Le Prince conducted his ground-breaking work in 1888 in the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

In October 1888, Le Prince filmed moving picture sequences, Roundhay Garden Scene and Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge, using his single-lens camera and Eastman''s paper film. These were several years before the work of competing inventors such as Auguste and Louis Lumière or Thomas Edison.

He was never able to perform a planned public demonstration in the United States because he mysteriously vanished from a train on 16 September 1890. His body and luggage were never found, but, over a century later, a police archive was found to contain a photograph of a drowned man who could have been him.

Not long after Le Prince''s disappearance, Thomas Edison tried to take credit for the invention. But Le Prince’s widow and son, Adolphe, were keen to advance his cause as the inventor of cinematography. In 1898, Adolphe appeared as a witness for the defense in a court case brought by Edison against the American Mutoscope Company, claiming that Edison was the first and sole inventor of cinematography (and thus entitled to royalties for the use of the process). He was not allowed to present the two cameras as evidence (and so establish Le Prince’s prior claim as inventor) and eventually the court ruled in favor of Edison.

Marion Byron (born Miriam Bilenkin; March 16, 1911, Dayton, Ohio – July 5, 1985, Santa Monica, California) was an American movie comedian.  After following her sister into a short stage career as a singer/dancer, she was given her first movie role as Buster Keaton''s leading lady in the film Steamboat Bill, Jr. in 1928. From there she was hired by Hal Roach to co-star in short subjects with Max Davidson, Edgar Kennedy, and Charley Chase, but most significantly with Anita Garvin, where tiny (4''11" in high heels) Marion was teamed with the 6'' Anita for a brief three-film series as a "female Laurel & Hardy" in 1928–1929.

She left Roach before they made talkies, but she went on working, now in musical features, like the Vitaphone film Broadway Babies (1929) with Alice White, and the early Technicolor feature, Golden Dawn (1930).

Her parts slowly got smaller until they were unbilled walk-ons in films like Meet the Baron (1933), starring Jack Pearl and Hips Hips Hooray (1934) with Wheeler & Woolsey. Her final screen appearance was as a baby nurse to the Dionne Quintuplets in their film, Five of a Kind (1938).', 'Dayton, Ohio, USA', 1, '/i92RkzVMf95ZWSRzNEg7yNiUTWK.jpg'),

Although he had never received any formal training in acting, he managed to earn great respect of both filmmakers and audience members. 

He performed in some 50 Slovak, Czech, German, Hungarian and UK/US movies, but he will be most remembered for portraying the lead character of Mikoláš in the Czech movie Marketa Lazarová.

Velecký was born 8 March 1934 in Zvolen. He originally studied civil engineering and worked as a designer for few years. However, since his early age he was attracted by the world of cinema and finally in his 30s managed to get his first major roles. 

Practically at the beginning of his acting career, after a few minor films including Každý týždeň sedem dní (1964) and Nylonový mesiac (1965), he received the role of his lifetime in Marketa Lazarová (1966). This experience deeply influenced the rest of his life. 

In interviews, he described with gratitude how the director František Vláčil completely changed his way of seeing the world during the long production of this movie. 

Despite the impact the role had on the film (widely considered the best Czech cinema) and on his life, Velecký would probably be more recognized by Western audiences for his appearances in The Brothers Grimm (released 2005) and the Academy Award-nominated Želary (2003). 

For most of his career, Velecký was free of any theatre company ties except being briefly associated with the Theatre of Spišká Nová Ves in the 1980s.

During his professional career, Velecký was not limited to acting. He was assistant director to Juraj Jakubisko on the film Zbehovia a pútnici (1968) and he applied his talent in fine arts during the 1990s.

Always concerned with social causes, Mazzio did pro bono legal work for the homeless. She noticed a commonality facing her clients and decided she could be more effective bringing their stories to a wider audience through film. To that end, she left the law firm to pursue her new career as a filmmaker and founded 50 Eggs, Inc., an independent film production company dedicated to creating films with social impact.

John Roche (February 6, 1893 – November 10, 1952) was an American actor of the stage and screen.

Roche was born in the small village of Penn Yan, New York, on February 6, 1893. He graduated from the University of Rochester, after which he began his acting career touring with stock companies during the 1910s and early 1920s. In 1922, he broke into the film industry with a featured role in The Good Provider. During the 1920s, he acted in both films and on stage, including several roles in Broadway productions. He acted steadily in films until 1936, in both featured and supporting roles. In the mid-1930s he took a break from films, focusing on the stage, including directing the play, Mackerel Skies, which had a short run at the Playhouse Theatre in New York in 1936. Roche returned to films in 1941, with a small role in the Norma Shearer vehicle, We Were Dancing (1942), based on the Noël Coward play of the same name. Over the course of his career he was involved in over half a dozen Broadway productions and appeared in over 50 films. His final screen appearance was in 1946''s The Brute Man.

In the WWF, he found his greatest success as Mr. Perfect, a nickname introduced in his second run with the company which gradually became his official ring name. Hennig used the same ring name in his third and final run, however, his real name was widely acknowledged. He was the son of wrestler Larry "The Axe" Hennig, and father to current WWE (formerly the WWF) superstar Joe "Curtis Axel" Hennig.  Hennig is recognized by WWE as a one-time world champion, having held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship for 373 days (the seventh-longest reign in history). He won three additional world championships: the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship once, and the i-Generation World Heavyweight Championship twice. A two-time WWF Intercontinental Champion, Hennig has been named by WWE as one of the greatest Intercontinental Champions of all time, and was the longest-reigning champion of the 1990s. In addition to winning multiple championships in WCW during the late 1990s, he served as the enforcer of the Four Horsemen, a member of the New World Order, and leader of stable and country music group, West Texas Rednecks, who recorded the tongue-in-cheek song, "Rap is Crap", later described by WWE as a "stunningly popular and infectious earworm." Hennig returned to the WWF for a brief period in 2002, being one of the last three men remaining at the Royal Rumble. He later challenged for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in TNA, prior to his death on February 10, 2003.  WCW described Hennig as "one of the best all-round competitors this business has ever produced"; WWE, in a posthumous publication, hailed him as a "flawless technician" who "brought the Intercontinental Title a new level of credibility during his two reigns and set a higher standard for technical wrestling in WWE." He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007 by former Major League Baseball third baseman, and longtime friend, Wade Boggs. A number of Hennig''s peers consider him to be one of the greatest in-ring performers of all time; former on-screen rival Hulk Hogan remarked: "Everybody would check their egos at the door when they came to a building that Curt Hennig was in, because you couldn''t out-work him, you couldn''t outshine him and you couldn''t out-perform him. He was the best of the best."  On February 10, 2003, Hennig was found dead in a Florida hotel room. The Hillsborough County Medical Examiner''s Office declared acute cocaine intoxication to be the cause of his death. His father said that steroids and painkillers also contributed to his death.

WWE aired a video tribute as well as words from friends and former co-workers Jerry "The King" Lawler and Jim Ross on Raw following the news of Hennig''s death. TNA paid tribute to Hennig by displaying his wrestling singlet and a framed photo as he was employed by TNA at the time of his death. A tribute song about Hennig, "My Perfect Friend", was featured on the 2003 "Macho Man" Randy Savage album Be a Man. Other peers including Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels have also commended Hennig''s in-ring talents.', 'Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA', 1, '/j6j1deCpiAmQHiClxLiHMEwJ2AH.jpg'),

William King Baggot (November 7, 1879 – July 11, 1948) was an American actor, film director and screenwriter. He was an internationally famous movie star of the silent film era. The first individually publicized leading man in America, Baggot was referred to as "King of the Movies", "The Most Photographed Man in the World", and "The Man Whose Face Is As Familiar As The Man In The Moon".

Baggot appeared in over 300 motion pictures from 1909 to 1947, wrote 18 screenplays, and directed 45 movies from 1912 to 1928, including The Lie (1912), Raffles: The Amateur Cracksman (1925), and The House of Scandal (1928). He also directed William S. Hart in his most famous western, Tumbleweeds (1925).

Among his film appearances, Baggot was best known for The Scarlet Letter (1911), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1913), and Ivanhoe (1913).

Baggot began his career on the stage, in a Shakespearean stock company, and toured throughout the U.S.

While acting in stock in St. Louis in 1909, he was cast as supporting player in the Schubert touring production of The Wishing Ring. When The Wishing Ring closed in Chicago, Baggot returned to New York to join another company. Upon a chance meeting with Harry Solter, who was directing movies for Carl Laemmle at Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP), he was persuaded to go with Solter to the studio. Baggot became interested in the fledgling industry and decided to turn picture player.

His first film was the romance short The Awakening of Bess (1909) opposite Florence Lawrence. It was directed by Harry Solter, her husband, at IMP in Fort Lee, New Jersey. At a time when screen actors worked anonymously, Baggot and Lawrence became the first "movie stars" to be given billing, a marquee, and promotion in advertising.

Baggot starred in at least 42 movies opposite Lawrence from 1909 to 1911. In the latter year, he starred in at least 16 movies with Mary Pickford.

He also began writing screenplays and directing, all the while becoming a major star internationally. When he appeared "in person" at theatres he was mobbed at stage doors.

By 1912, he was so famous that when he took the leading part in forming the prestigious Screen Club in New York, the first organization of its kind strictly for movie people, he was the natural choice for its first president.

King Baggot died in Los Angeles, California in 1948, age 68.

For his contributions to the film industry, Baggot received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. His star is located at 6312 Hollywood Boulevard.', 'St. Louis, Missouri, USA', 1, '/zELAQQXooE3mrQlJTHHHb6wziQE.jpg'),

Susan Boyle''s initial appearance on the talent show fired public imagination when her modest stage introduction and thick speaking accent left audience, viewers and judges alike unprepared for the power and expression of her mezzo-soprano voice. Before she had finished the song''s opening phrase a standing ovation for Boyle had erupted.   An international media and Internet response coincided. Within nine days of the audition, videos of Boyle—from the show, various interviews and her 1999 rendition of "Cry Me a River"—had been watched over 100 million times. Despite becoming an international sensation she eventually finished in second place on the show behind dance troupe Diversity.   

On 12 May 2012, Susan returned to Britain''s Got Talent to perform as a guest in the final singing "You''ll See". The following day, she performed at Windsor Castle for the Queen''s Diamond Jubilee Pageant singing "Mull of Kintyre". In November 2012, Boyle performed with her idol Donny Osmond in Las Vegas, singing "This is the Moment", a duet from her most recent album Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs From the Stage.  Boyle''s net worth was estimated at £22 million in April 2012.  As of 2013, Boyle had sold over 19 million albums worldwide and received two Grammy Awards nominations.

Born in York, Western Australia, Enid Bennett started her film acting career in 1916, first starring in Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford, with two other films that same year. She married American director Sidney Franklin early in her career, but they were divorced shortly thereafter.

In 1917, she starred in five films, the most important of which was The Little Brother opposite William Garwood. That film brought her to the attention of studios and led to an increasing number of acting roles. From 1918 to 1921, she starred in twenty-three films, becoming well known and recognizable as an actress. In 1918 she married director Fred Niblo, who later directed the second film version of Ben Hur. In 1922, she starred in only three films, but one of those became her most famous role, the female lead of "Maid Marian" in Robin Hood with Douglas Fairbanks.

From 1923 to 1928, she starred in only ten films, as her career had slowed to a crawl. She was a mother by that time, as she and Niblo eventually had three children together.

In 1929, her brother Alexander Bennett married actress Frances Lee. The wedding was attended by some of Hollywood''s biggest names, including Gloria Swanson and Greta Garbo. That year Bennett starred in only one film, Good Medicine, opposite Edward Everett Horton.

Bennett''s sisters Marjorie (1896-1982) and Catherine (1901–1978) were also Hollywood film actresses.

She made a semi-successful transition to sound films, but saw fewer roles come her way. From 1931 to 1941 she had roles in only seven films, the last of which was uncredited.

She retired after 1941, eventually residing with her family in Malibu, California, where she died in 1969 from a heart attack, aged 75.', 'York, Western Australia, Australia', 1, '/1vQDnUFq2XnAuxGuYiJFImiBa85.jpg'),

Ann was adopted and raised by her maternal grandparents, and her official adopted name was Ann Todd Mayfield. Her grandparents took her to the movies often and hoped that she would one day become a child star like Shirley Temple (incidentally, she would have a small role as Temple''s little sister in "The Blue Bird 1940"). Ann''s grandparents eventually prodded her into a career in film, and although she was not particularly interested in acting -- her childhood ambition was to be a pilot -- she excelled at it and became one of the most popular child stars of the 1930s and ''40s. In the early 1940s, she added E to her professional name to avoid being mistaken for British actress Ann Todd. Nevertheless, the two were and are frequently confused. Despite her success, appearing in some 27 films between 1939 and 1951, Ann quit acting in the 1950s. She married her second husband Robert Basart on January 29, 1955, in Berkeley, California. In 1959, she was reunited with her parents, and following in her parents'' footsteps, she pursued a career in music. Ann received a master''s degree in music history from the University of California at Berkeley (UCB). She taught music history in San Francisco for 3 years and then served as the music librarian at UCB for 21 years. During this time, Ann also founded a publishing company, Fallen Leaf Press, and had two children, a daughter and a son. Her husband Robert died on February 7, 1993, in Berkeley.

On television Gans was the voices for both Kanga and Roo on the Walt Disney Channel children''s show "Welcome to Pooh Corner" and the voice of Drag Strip on the "Transformers" cartoon program. He was especially effective as the metallic voice of Crimebuster in the charming sci-fi comedy "Heartbeeps" and the sinister voice of Armus on the "Skin of Evil" episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation."

In the late 1940s he also began working as a make-up artist, which he transitioned full-time to in 1955; this was due to injuries sustained during a car accident, which left him physically disfigured.

        (955809, 'Fred ''Snowflake'' Toones', '1906-01-05', 'Fred "Snowflake" Toones was a character actor who appeared in over 200 films between 1928 and 1951. He often worked under contract for Republic Pictures, appearing in about 40 of its films.

He played a bootblack or shoeshine man in at least six of his movies, and Toones actually ran the shoeshine stand at Republic Studios.

He first appeared as a porter in 1932 in The Hurricane Express and was usually typecast as a porter - appearing in over 50 films in such a role. He also played a variety of other service-oriented or domestic worker roles such as stable grooms, janitors, elevator operators, valets, cooks, bellhops, doormen, butlers, and bartenders. Like other actors of the time, i.e. Anna May Wong and Franklin Pangborn, Toones is a prime example of racial and social stereotyping in the Hollywood film industry.

His standard characterization was that of a middle-aged "colored" man with a high-pitched voice and childlike mannerisms.

"Snowflake" was the stage name Toones was best known by, and he used this name as his credit as early as his third film, 1931''s Shanghaied Love. Likewise, in Shanghaied Love and over 35 other films, "Snowflake" was also Toones'' character name.

He acted in films such as Mississippi (1935), Hawk of the Wilderness (1938), and Daredevils of the Red Circle (1939) with Bruce Bennett and in many "B" westerns such as The Lawless Nineties (1936) with John Wayne. He also appeared in dozens of two-reelers such as Columbia''s Woman Haters (1934) with the Three Stooges, and had a bit role in Laurel and Hardy''s classic feature Way Out West (1937). Toones is also a familiar face in four Preston Sturges comedies: Twentieth Century (1934), Remember the Night (1940), Christmas in July (1940), and The Palm Beach Story (1942).

He died on 13 February 1962 in Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'North Carolina, USA', 1, '/w2jl2Iuxg8tVctqx8I4hDM0W9wR.jpg'),

Meyer came to America in 1923 from her native Germany. She subsequently became a U.S. citizen.

Wuornos claimed that her victims had either raped or attempted to rape her while she was working as a prostitute, and that all of the killings were committed in self-defense. She was convicted and sentenced to death for six of the murders and was executed by the State of Florida by lethal injection on October 9, 2002.  Childhood:  Wuornos was born as Aileen Carol Pittman in Rochester, Michigan, on February 29, 1956.[2] Her mother, Diane Wuornos (born 1939), was 15 years old when she married Aileen''s father, Leo Dale Pittman (died 1969), on June 3, 1954. Less than two years later, and two months before Aileen was born, Diane filed for divorce. Aileen had an older brother named Keith, who was born in March 1955.  Wuornos never met her father, Leo Pittman. He was in prison for the rape and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl when she was born. He was considered to be a schizophrenic, was convicted of sex crimes against children, was in and out of prison, and hanged himself in prison in 1969. In January 1960, when Aileen was almost four years old, Diane abandoned her children, leaving them with their maternal grandparents, Lauri and Britta Wuornos, who legally adopted Keith and Aileen on March 18, 1960.  At age 11, Wuornos engaged in sexual activities in school in exchange for cigarettes, drugs, and food. She had also engaged in sexual activities with her brother. Wuornos claimed that she was sexually assaulted and beaten as a child by her grandfather, an alcoholic. According to her accusations, before beating her, he would force her to strip out of her clothes. In 1970, at age 14, she became pregnant, having been raped by a friend of her grandfather. Wuornos gave birth at a home for unwed mothers, and the child was placed for adoption. A few months after her baby was born, Wuornos dropped out of school[3] at about the time that her grandmother died of liver failure; Wuornos and her brother subsequently became wards of the court. When she was 15, her grandfather threw her out of the house, and she began supporting herself as a prostitute and living in the woods near her old home.  Early criminal career:

On May 27, 1974, Wuornos was arrested in Jefferson County, Colorado, for driving under the influence (DUI), disorderly conduct, and firing a .22-caliber pistol from a moving vehicle. She was later charged with failure to appear.  In 1976, Wuornos hitchhiked to Florida, where she met 69-year-old yacht club president Lewis Gratz Bell. They married that same year, and the announcement of their nuptials was printed in the society pages of the local newspaper. However, Wuornos continually involved herself in confrontations at their local bar and eventually went to jail for assault. She also hit Bell with his own cane, leading him to get a restraining order against her. She returned to Michigan where, on July 14, 1976, she was arrested in Antrim County, Michigan, and charged with assault and disturbing the peace for throwing a cue ball at a bartender''s head. On July 17, her brother Keith died of esophageal cancer and Wuornos received $10,000 from his life insurance. Wuornos and Bell annulled their marriage on July 21 after only nine weeks.

On May 20, 1981, Wuornos was arrested in Edgewater, Florida, for the armed robbery of a convenience store, where she stole $35 and two packs of cigarettes. She was sentenced to prison on May 4, 1982, and released on June 30, 1983. On May 1, 1984, Wuornos was arrested for attempting to pass forged checks at a bank in Key West. On November 30, 1985, she was named as a suspect in the theft of a revolver and ammunition in Pasco County.  On January 4, 1986, Wuornos was arrested in Miami and charged with grand theft auto, resisting arrest, and obstruction of justice for providing identification with her aunt''s name. Miami police officers found a .38-caliber revolver and a box of ammunition in the stolen car. On June 2, 1986, Volusia County, Florida, deputy sheriffs detained Wuornos for questioning after a male companion accused her of pulling a gun, in his car, and demanding $200. Wuornos was found to be carrying spare ammunition, and a .22 pistol was discovered under the passenger seat she had occupied.  Around this time, Wuornos met Tyria Moore, a hotel maid, at a Daytona gay bar. They moved in together, and Wuornos supported them with her prostitution earnings. On July 4, 1987, Daytona Beach police detained Wuornos and Moore at a bar for questioning regarding an incident in which they were accused of assault and battery with a beer bottle. On March 12, 1988, Wuornos accused a Daytona Beach bus driver of assault. She claimed that he pushed her off the bus following a confrontation. Moore was listed as a witness to the incident.

Emney was born in Prescot, Lancashire, the son of Blanche (née Round) and Fred Emney, a music hall entertainer. His great-uncle was the actor Arthur Williams. Emney junior grew up in London and was educated at Cranleigh School.

He made his film debut in 1935, having previously worked in music hall. He became a familiar figure to screen audiences, usually playing the "posh fat bloke", usually gruff and invariably wearing a monocle. During the 1950s, he had his own television show which featured sketches and deft piano pieces often composed by him. Some were released on record. He had a short spell as straight man to puppets Pinky and Perky.

His sister Joan Emney was an actress who sometimes appeared with him in the same stage productions.

Nora Cecil (September 20, 1878 – May 1, 1951) was a British-American character actress whose 30-year career spanned both the silent and sound film eras.  Cecil''s career began on the stage, where she appeared in a single Broadway production, The Sleeping Beauty and the Beast, which ran for more than 240 performances at the Broadway Theatre in 1901-02. (A 1930 newspaper article says that Cecil "made her debut, three decades ago, on the London stage.")

Cecil appeared in well over 100 feature films and film shorts.

In 1915, she moved from the stage into films, her first appearance being in a starring role in The Arrival of Perpetua, directed by Émile Chautard. She often played "thin-lipped, stern-visaged dowagers and forbidding mothers-in-law" and "welfare workers, landladies, schoolmistresses and maiden aunts".

One of the most significant roles was in the W.C. Fields vehicle, The Old Fashioned Way in 1934. Some of the other notable films in which Cecil appeared include: Ernst Lubitsch''s historical romance, The Merry Widow, starring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald; the 1939 version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, starring Mickey Rooney; the John Ford classic, Stagecoach, with John Wayne.

Duany made his debut as an actor in the 2004 philosophical comedy film "I Heart Huckabees," in which he played a refugee called Stephen Nimieri. Duany was picked for the role because the film''s producer and director David O. Russell wanted someone who had endured the real life experience of being a refugee. In 2010, Duany made an uncredited appearance in another Russell film, "The Fighter," starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. He later had a much important role in the 2011 drama "Restless City." In 2010, he produced and starred in the documentary "Ger: To Be Separate," about his search for his family, after 18 years apart, his long journey from a war child to a refugee to a Hollywood actor and an international model, his return to South Sudan, voting for the first time and celebrating the country''s newly acquired independence on July 9, 2011.  - IMDb Mini Biography', 'Akobo - South Sudan', 1, '/pkkLYJQnpjfBJRJeFgkWd2uDDCF.jpg'),

        (996558, 'Alena Mihulová', '1965-05-04', 'Aleně Mihulové bylo přesně sedmnáct let, zrovna studovala ekonomickou školu a spolupracovala s pražským amatérským Aneb divadlem, když jí kamarádka informovala o konkursu na film SESTŘIČKY (1983) režiséra Karla Kachyňi. Navlékli ji do spodního prádla z padesátých let a do ruky dostala scénář. Roli začínající sestřičky Marie po boku Jiřiny Jiráskové dostala z desítek mnohem zkušenějších uchazeček, k čemuž prohlásila: "Když dnes vzpomínám na Sestřičky, musím říct, že to byla jedna z nejhezčích a nejšťastnějších věcí, které mě kdy potkaly. Nikdy nezapomenu, jak skvěle mě, takové trdlo, všichni přijali a snažili se mi pomáhat. A hlavně - potkala jsem při natáčení muže svého života." Tehdy ještě nevěděla, kdo režisér snímku Karel Kachyňa, kterého ve štábu přezdívali „železný dědek“, je a jakým způsobem ovlivní její další život.  Během natáčení sestřiček se do o čtyřicet let staršího muže zamilovala a vyšel z toho osobitý vztah, jenž změnil jak její osobní život, tak i hereckou kariéru. Své nejlepší role ztvárnila právě „pod taktovkou“ Karla Kachyňi. Vztah po desetiletém utajování zpečetili svatbou a k sedmdesátinám Alena nadělila svému režisérovi dar v podobě dcery Karolínky. V té době natočili jeden z nejlepších společných snímků drama KRÁVA (1994). V průběhu natáčení filmu byl málokdo informován o jejich vztahu. Film Kráva je skutečně respektovaným českým snímkem, jenž slavil mezinárodní úspěch a o kterém se redaktor New York Post Larry Worth nezdráhal napsat, že působí, jako kdyby Ingmar Bergman natočil Forresta Gumpa.  Rozhodně však neměla u svého partnera protekci v obsazování do rolí, důkazem čehož je fakt, že se objevila celkem ve čtyřech jeho snímcích: SESTŘIČKY (1983), SMRT KRÁSNÝCH SRNCŮ (1986), MĚSTEM CHODÍ MIKULÁŠ (1993) a KRÁVA (1994), i přes to že sám Kachyňa od jejich seznámení natočil patnáct celovečerních filmů a tři seriály. Režisér jejich profesní spolupráci popsal následovně: "U mě žádná taková protekce neplatí. Znám Alenku dobře, její osobní náturu i naturel herecký. Takže vím, že může hrát jen určitý typ rolí. A abych ji obsazoval do jiných, to bych si řezal větev sám pod sebou."  Mimo Kachyňových filmů ztvárnila ještě hlavní roli v DŽUSOVÉM ROMÁNU (1984) Fera Feniče, objevila se v televizním filmu Morrise Issy DEN DOBRÝCH SKUTKŮ (2000), také v počinu F.A.

Nicole attended Santa Susana High School in Simi Valley.  Nichole went on to attend USC as a Theater major and graduated early,  after three years. She says it was a challenge for her to get cast in  the university''s own plays because she dedicated so much of her spare  time to professional auditions outside of school.

She started her career in 2010 with the lead role in the independent short film Everyday. The next year she starred in another short film, Carpool, opposite Morgan Pavey and Andy Dulman. She gained widespread recognition in 2012 as JB''s Girl in Project X. Project X was a box office success, earning 100.9 million in total box office sales, on a budget of only 12 million.

In 2012 she starred in the independent film Model Minority, her first lead role.

Born in Riverside County, California on February 1, 1987 to parents Ron Rousey and AnnMaria DeMars, little Ronda was born with an umbilical cord wrapped around her neck that damaged her vocal chords. She didn''t speak coherently until the age of six. Ronda was a self-professed tomboy and swam from the ages of 6 to 10. She competed on the Jr. Olympic swim team where she placed in the state level.

Because of her mother, a 7th degree black belt and 1984 World Judo Champion, Ronda took up the sport. She had a hard time socializing with other kids and found that Judo gave her confidence. She holds a 4th degree black belt in the martial art.

Ronda''s Judo career is a storied one. At 17 she became the youngest judoka in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. That same year she won a gold medal at the World Junior Judo Championships in Budapest, and in 2006 she became the first U.S. female in almost 10 years to win an A-Level tournament going 5-0 to clench the gold at the World Cup in Great Britain. At 19 she won the bronze medal at the Junior World Championships. She is the first U.S. athlete to win two Junior World Medals. In 2007 she added a silver at the World Judo Championships and a gold at the Pan American Games. The pinnacle of her Judo career was a bronze at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Rousey became the first American to win an Olympic medal in women''s Judo since it became an Olympic sport in 1992.

After medaling in the Olympics, Ronda''s career hit a dead end. She did some bartending to make ends meet and tried to find a better paying job, but it was tough finding anyone that needed her particular skill set. Throwing people down and putting them in armbars aren''t really something you can put on a resume. By chance Ronda caught the Gina Carano

 vs. Julie Kedzie fight on television and things changed.

She made her mixed martial arts debut as an amateur in 2010. Since then she has never lost a fight, winning the majority in the first round by armbar submission. Ronda took it upon herself to chase after and demand attention so that the UFC could no longer ignore women fighters. UFC President Dana White

 had publicly stated that women would never be allowed to fight in the UFC, but on February 23, 2013, Ronda did just that. She won the fight against Liz Carmouche in the first round with her signature armbar and became the first UFC Women''s Bantamweight Champion.

Ronda will be appearing in her first motion picture - Expendables 3

 (2014). Other projects are Fast & Furious 7 (2015) and The Athena Project as well as Entourage(2015).  - IMDb Mini Biography', 'Santa Monica - California - USA', 2, '/5eGHTV1bLOdajC4Z3pnIdSiptSG.jpg'),

Ihr Germanistik- und Psychologiestudium an der Freien Universität Berlinbrach sie bald ab, um nach New York zu gehen. Dort besuchte sie die Neighborhood Playhouse School of Theatre von Sanford Meisner. Sie studierte gemeinsam mit Philip Seymour Hoffman mehrere Jahre bei dem Method-Lehrer Tony Greco. An der Columbia University, Graduate Film Division arbeitete sie mit Leonore de Koven in Directing Actors in Film, wirkte in Studentenfilmen mit, nahm weiteren Schauspielunterricht und stand als Gründungsmitglied einer Theatergruppe auf der Bühne, unter anderem in John Patrick Shanleys Stücken Danny and the Deep Blue Sea als Roberta und in Savage in Limbo in der Rolle der April White. Hanold-Lynch war verheiratet mit James E. Lynch, dessen Namen sie nach der Trennung behielt. 1994 kehrte sie nach Berlin zurück. Von 1999 bis 2010 arbeitete sie durchgängig als Schauspiel-Coach vorbereitend und am Set für unterschiedlichste Film- und Fernsehproduktionen, beginnend mit der Serie St. Angela. Als Dozentin konzipierte und präsentierte sie 2001 den Live-Workshop „Kamera läuft!“ im Rahmen des SAT.1 Actors’ Day auf dem Filmfest München, bei dem sie junge Leute aus dem Publikum live vor laufender Kamera coachte. 2009 entschied sie sich für einen künstlerischen Neuanfang als Schauspielerin. Parallel dazu systematisierte sie eigene Techniken der Rollenerarbeitung und ist seit 2010 als freier Coach und als Dozentin für Internationale Castings am iSFF (Institut für Schauspiel, Film- und Fernsehberufe Berlin) tätig. Stephen Daldry legte Hanold-Lynch beim Casting für Der Vorleser nahe, ihre eigene Schauspielkarriere voranzutreiben und Drehbuchautor David Hare schrieb ihr eine Rolle ins Drehbuch. Die Begegnung bewirkte, dass sich Hanold-Lynch beruflich neu ausrichtete. Seither hat sie Nebenrollen in weiteren großen internationalen Kinoproduktionen gespielt, u. a. an der Seite von Liam Neeson in Unknown Identity, an der Seite von Tom Hanks in Cloud Atlas, zuletzt als Tochter von Tilda Swinton und Schwester von Adrien Brody in Wes Andersons Grand Budapest Hotel. Auch in Deutschland stellt sie seit 2009 in Kino- und Fernsehproduktionen ihre Wandlungsfähigkeit unter Beweis. Franziska Augstein schrieb in der Süddeutschen Zeitung über ihre Figur der Else Weidt in Ein blinder Held – Die Liebe des Otto Weidt: „Dieser Film ist großes Kino (...) Großartig ist Heike Hanold-Lynch, die als Weidts verbittert-verbiesterte, eifersüchtige und nicht besonders attraktive Ehefrau auftritt.“ Neben Edgar Selge in der Titelrolle spielt sie in dem Film, welcher auf Erlebnissen Inge Deutschkrons während der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus basiert, eine unpolitische Frau, die die große Liebe ihres Mannes vor den Nazis versteckt. Neben anderen Filmprojekten besetzte Friedemann Fromm sie in der ersten Staffel der mit dem Deutschen Fernsehpreis ausgezeichneten ErfolgsserieWeissensee als Stasi-Mitarbeiterin Erika Bergner. Für Andres Veiel war sie als Mentorin Gudrun Ensslins in Wer wenn nicht wir zu sehen und für Marc-Andreas Bochert in einer Hauptrolle als Richterin an der Seite von Christoph Bach in Dyslexie. 2014 stand sie u. a. für Oskar Roehlers 80er-Jahre-Film Tod den Hippies, es lebe der Punk vor der Kamera.

She began her modelling career in 2003 in the Netherlands and quickly was sent by her agency to New York where she was cast by lingerie giant Victoria’s Secret. She became a Victoria''s Secret Angel for the brand in 2008. She has been a brand ambassador and spokesperson for L''Oréal Paris for over 5 years. Kroes has been in the top five of best-paid models, with an estimated income of more than five million per year since 2008. In 2014, she came in second on the Forbes top-earning models list, estimated to have earned $8 million in one year. She is considered one of the "New Supers" and described as "Helen of Troy of advertising" by Models.com.

Unlike most fellow top models, Kroes got acquainted with the fashion world relatively late. She is one of few highly successful professional models who was not discovered by any scouting agency. She got accepted at Paparazzi Model Management in Amsterdam after sending some of her holiday pictures. Her first breakthrough was when she was featured on cover of Vogue Italia in 2005. Steven Meisel shot her pictures for the cover. Just as she started her career as model for Victoria''s Secret, she was voted as "Model of The Year" on Vogue.com in the year 2005. The year 2013 was a significantly successful year for her modeling career. In September 2013, she appeared on covers of four international editions of Vogue, making her the first model/celebrity in the history. The September issues are generally regarded as the most important issue of the year for fashion magazines, especially Vogue. She had been featured on a total of 9 Vogue covers, a count more than any other model, just in the year 2013.

He is the narrator of History TV''s ''The Real Inglorious Bastards'' directed by Gemini-winner Min Sook Lee which won the 2014 Canadian Screen Awards'' "Best History or Biography Documentary Program or Series'' award.  Robert Nolan''s adaptability on-screen stems from a richly varied life. Born in Dublin, Ireland and raised in Canada''s wild Alberta west, Nolan has the experience of the new immigrant. He has worked white-collar and blue, then came to acting when completing his B.A. in English.He has since embarked on a career seeking out challenging varieties of roles in quality stories in every medium.   Nolan works on stage and screen, appearing in dramas and comedies including ''Jim Jones'' in ''Jonestown'', the evil doctor of ''Twisted Pieces'', a doctor reforming willful women in ''Silent Retreat'' and as the husband whose grief is subsumed by rage in the comedy ''Mourning Has Broken''. In other film roles, he is a no-nonsense FBI agent taking control of an alien crash on an isolated farm in ''The Picco Incident'', a reluctant and humane zombie hunter in ''Sick'', a husband whose thoughts may not be his own in the critically-acclaimed award-winning ''Familiar'', a desperate lab scientist in ''Canswer'' and an uncertain bank robber in ''Battleground’. 

Nolan appears as a father whose world has fallen away with the death of his daughter by a drunk driver in ''MADD Shattered'' which played to high school students across Canada. He is cast in the lead in the upcoming ''Tales From Hell'' in four distinct roles as a man whose many lives return him to the bonds of the fiery underworld.  Theatre roles include the lead in ''The Trial of Ken Gass'', ''Bethune'' and principal roles in ''The Great Gatsby'', ''Rebel Without a Cause'' and ''Macbeth''. QUOTES: "There aren''t many actors in Canada these days who are as intense, versatile and blessed with a wonderful sexy-ugly 70s-style screen presence as the criminally underused Robert Nolan. In another time and place, Nolan would have been a bonafide star - not in the pretty boy mould, but rather in the chiseled and alternately tough and sensitive manner of a Gene Hackman, a Ron Leibman or even a Harvey Keitel. He''s got leading man sensibilities, but the kind that would lead to what I like to think of as starring character roles. And yes, he''s got the stuff, obviously, to be a great character actor in supporting roles, but he''s proven thus far to be so goddamn good, I want to see as much of the guy onscreen as possible.” - - (Greg Klymkiw, Film Corner) "Robert Nolan has great comedy chops. No one plays Hitler funnier than Nolan." - - (Steve Markle - Testees, Camp Hollywood) "A fine actor... a very strong talent yet to be discovered by Hollywood." - - (Tommy Chang - Pacific Rim, Nikita) AWARDS: Best Actor - Mourning Has Broken (Las Vegas, Laughlin International Film Festival 2013) -

Juanita Quigley (24 June 1931 – 29 October 2017) was an American child actress in motion pictures of the 1930s and 1940s. She had a sister, Rita Quigley, who was also a child actress.

Juanita Quigley was billed as "Baby Jane" in several early roles. Her screen debut was as Claudette Colbert''s three-year-old daughter in Imitation of Life (1934). She went on to play featured parts in several films, including The Man Who Reclaimed His Head (1934) and was Jean Harlow''s niece in Riffraff (1936). Quigley became a familiar face to moviegoers of the era, but major roles for children so young were few and she often played bits as well as featured roles. She was one of the most popular child stars of her day, and was Universal Pictures'' youngest star in 1934.

Quigley was briefly involved in the Our Gang film series. In 1940, she was the guest-starring lead in The New Pupil when cast as Sally, who briefly takes Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer away from Darla Hood. Two years later, she reprised the character in Going to Press (1942), the only time in the MGM era where the female lead was played by someone other than Darla Hood (who had recently left the series) or Janet Burston.

Quigley acted alongside her older sister, Rita Quigley, in Whispering Footsteps (1943). Her last major role was in National Velvet (1944), in which she played Elizabeth Taylor''s sister.

Quigley made only a handful of small appearances after National Velvet, her last being in 1950. At the age of 20, in August 1951, she became a religious sister in the order of the Daughters of Mary and Joseph, teaching at Precious Blood Catholic School. After several years in her convent, she left the vocation and married.

Inaccurate documentation exists that Juanita made an uncredited appearance as an extra in the locally filmed Porky''s II: The Next Day. At the time of this filming, Juanita lived in Pennsylvania pursuing her post-convent career full-time. Juanita was retired and was an intensely private person with regard to her past. Most who knew her as a friend were unaware of her previous life as an actress. As of 2016, Juanita lived a peaceful retired life with her son and daughter-in-law in Massachusetts.

Arkoff sent Rusoff to Italy in the late 60''s to help get their dubbing system set up to American standards but Rusoff ended up living in Rome for the rest of his life. Rusoff''s voice can be heard in the English versions of over 250 Italian, Japanese, Russian, and various European films. He also lent his voice to several big budget American films including THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. Beginning in the late 1970''s, Rusoff tried his hand at acting in front of the camera too as it was relatively easy for native English speakers in Italy to find acting work at the time. He acted alongside greats including Bob Hoskins and Max von Sydow, and in the dubbing studio alongside such dubbing legends as Robert Rietty, Geoffrey Copleston, Nick Alexander, Lewis E. Cianelli, and Mickey Knox.

Cast mostly as monks, elders and religious figures due to his large beard, Rusoff appeared in such bible epics as THE DAY CHRIST DIED and THE NATIVITY STORY as well as monks in DOUBLE TEAM and CATACOMBS. His most prestigious role is perhaps as the chief elder in PASSION OF THE CHRIST who throws the bag of money at Judas. Rusoff, being fluent in several languages including traditional Hebrew and ancient Aramaic, worked as chief translator for the film as well.

Rusoff married fellow voice actor / dubber Carolyn De Fonseca but the two had an open marriage.

Alice Beatrice Roberts (March 7, 1905 – July 24, 1970) was an American film actress. She was briefly married to the cartoonist and showman Robert L. Ripley and a mistress of Louis B. Mayer.

She married Robert Ripley at age 14 on October 31, 1919, about the time he invented his Believe It or Not cartoon strip. The marriage was short lived—they separated three months later and were divorced in 1926. Ripley never spoke about the marriage, calling himself a "confirmed bachelor".

After her marriage, Roberts entered several beauty pageants including the 1924 and 1925 Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey (as Miss Manhattan, 1924, and Miss Greater New York, 1925). She won the "Most Beautiful Girl in Evening Gown" award each time.

She went to Hollywood in 1933 and between then and 1946, she appeared in nearly 60 films, including Tall Timber (1937) and Love Takes Flight (also 1937), in which she starred opposite Bruce Cabot. Many of her roles were small and uncredited. Her most notable role was that of Queen Azura in Flash Gordon''s Trip to Mars, a 1938 serial.

She was a mistress to MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer in 1935 and 1936, while under contract to his company. In the 1940s, Roberts married John Wesley Smith.

Her last movie contract was with Universal, and her final appearances were in Criss-Cross and Family Honeymoon. Her acting career never becoming the success she had dreamed of, she left Hollywood in 1949. She died in Plymouth, Massachusetts from pneumonia, aged 65.', 'Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA', 1, '/cobja3GKDVjTZdVH2TCzJ4TBO3m.jpg'),

Jason was raised the youngest of four boys by his parents Robert and Sandra Vail. Born outside of Chicago on the Great Lakes, Jason grew up a Navy brat and spent the majority of his childhood moving up and down the East coast from Rhode Island to Florida and even Puerto Rico. His first attempt at acting was at Lancaster High School in South Carolina, when he was cast as the lead in the drama club''s very first play. Unfortunately he never got to perform because he was persuaded by his year book advisor to drop out and focus on his job as the head yearbook photographer. He later became a photography major at Savannah College of Art and Design for the first couple years until he transferred to Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina to pursue his passion. Shortly after graduation he was cast in a Peter Bogdanovich movie of the week, The Price of Heaven (1997) (TV) playing the boy friend opposite the director''s real life daughter who was cast in a supporting role. He later graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with an MFA in acting. After graduation he moved to New York City to further pursue acting where he had the opportunity to work in several soaps, regional theater and eventually Off-Broadway. While in NYC he had the pleasure to study Meisner with acting instructor Wynn Handman at his Carnegie Hall studio. He worked in over forty independent films as well as numerous TV appearances while living in the NY and NJ area for nearly twelve years. Then in Dec of 2011, after his beloved mother''s unexpected passing, he decided it was time to move back south to be near his family. He continues his pursuit of acting in the Southeast region recently starring in the film Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies (2012) (V) to good reviews for his portrayal as John Wilkes Booth and many more.', 'Chicago, Illinois, USA', 1, '/rk308AVn1yU9LuYNiF3ZMwOBMB3.jpg'),

 Don McGraw was born in Chicago, Illinois, on May 2, 1966, to Donald P. McGraw, Jr., and the former Helen Ann Hughes. His father was a factory plant manager who made beer cans and his mother was a homemaker who previously had worked as a telephone operator for Illinois Bell. Because of his father''s job, Don moved around during his youth, living for only three years in his home town and then variously in Longview, Texas; Gretna, Louisiana; and finally in Warner Robins, Georgia.  

  In 1979, at the age of thirteen, Don auditioned for and won his first stage role: that of Noah Claypole in an adaptation of Charles Dickens'' Oliver Twist. He did so on the advice of a classmate who reported that teenage girls were in abundance in community theatre... and that friend was right!  

  What started out as a means to get dates quickly turned into a thirty-year avocation. Professionally, Don spent most of his adult life as a high school drama and English teacher, all the while amassing an impressive list of over 75 stage credits. Throughout these years, he also managed to direct around 45 plays and write another dozen. However, he never considered making a living at his craft until his mid-forties.  

  When he was 44 years old, Don developed some health problems which sidelined him from teaching. While recuperating, he and his wife decided that he should try his hand at film acting. Initially, he had planned on doing only background work to earn a little extra cash, but opportunities came so quickly and easily that he moved into full-fledged acting roles only after a month or so.  

  Don currently lives with his wife, Denise, in Central Georgia, which puts him right smack-dab in the middle of that state''s two largest markets for film and television acting: Atlanta and Savannah. When he''s not in front of the camera, Don spends his time raising his five sons, four dogs, and one very outnumbered cat. He is also a huge proponent of the American Association of Adaptive Sports Programs (AAASP), an organization of teams for wheelchair-bound student athletes, as he has two sons with Muscular Dystrophy.', 'Chicago, IL, USA', 1, '/b2D5jbRaLODBlvmsKY2LgDwTdcA.jpg'),

 Christopher Marrone is an American Actor known for his surreal presence on screen. Christopher was born in Tallahassee Florida to a Richard, a film and television actor, and Deborah Grund, a theatrical actor. The family of Chris, his older brother and parents remained in Tallahassee for a few years before moving to Orlando Florida, where Chris recalls being the kid always picked on. Christopher says it was rough growing up, but helped shape him into the man he is today.  

  Chris has always had a love for films. The idea of working in the entertainment industry was cultivated in him at a young age from hearing the stories from his mother and father about their experiences in he business. When in high school, Chris became involved with a TV Production Class, as well as football. Though working with his true love of TV/film production, he decided to take advantage of his youth and pursue a collegiate football career which began at Florida International University. After his freshman year of playing there he decided to leave FIU and was on the fence of whether or not he would pursue film or continue with Football. The opportunity arose for him to go to the University of Georgia. Again a moment of taking advantage of being young once he went on to play at the University of Georgia from 2008 to 2011.  

  After the conclusion of his football career, Chris got was contacted by Coach Van Halanger informing him of an individual searching for real football players who could act. Taking the leap of faith, Christopher headed to Atlanta from Athens and made the audition. Being his first ever major audition, he got the call back and then landed the role as Murphy in the NBC film "Field of Vision." Since "Field of Vision" he has worked on a multitude of feature and short films, to include "Wettest County in the World", "Double Sided", "The Carrington Event" and just recently "Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies."  

  Christopher is a very goal-oriented individual, his driven and humble approach into this business mixed with his amazing talent as an actor should equal success for this young man.

Performing with her all-female backing band The Bloody Crumpets, Autumn incorporates elements of classical music, cabaret, electronica, and glam rock with theatrics, and burlesque.

Growing up in Malibu, California, she began learning the violin at the age of four and left regular school five years later with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist; she practiced eight or nine hours a day and read a wide range of literature. Progressing to writing her own music, she studied under various teachers and went to Indiana University, which she left over issues regarding the relationship between classical music and the appearance of the performer. Through her own independent label Traitor Records, Autumn debuted with her classical album On a Day: Music for Violin &amp; Continuo, followed by the release in 2003 of her album Enchant.

She appeared in singer Courtney Love''s backing band on her 2004 America''s Sweetheart tour and returned to Europe. She released the 2006 album Opheliac with the German label Trisol Music Group. In 2007, she released Laced/Unlaced; the re-release of On a Day... appeared as Laced with songs on the electric violin as Unlaced. She later left Trisol to join New York-based The End Records in 2009 and release Opheliac in the United States, where previously it had only been available as an import. Currently she is on tour to promote her newest album Fight Like A Girl.

A former guitar instructor from Spokane, Washington, he has worked as a session musician and songwriter, making both studio and live appearances with several artists, and has been involved with several projects throughout his career.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Northern Idaho and Spokane, Kennedy attended Spokane Falls Community College to study music theory. He began his music career in 1990 as the lead guitarist of the instrumental jazz ensemble Cosmic Dust, with which he released one studio album. His second band, Citizen Swing, released two studio albums before disbanding in 1996. With fellow Citizen Swing member Craig Johnson, Kennedy founded the rock band The Mayfield Four, for which he provided lead vocals and guitar. The band released two studio albums and broke up in 2002. After declining an offer to audition as the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver, he was asked to join Alter Bridge by Mark Tremonti in late 2003, formally joining in 2004, and he has been with the band ever since. He has released five studio albums with Alter Bridge.

While Alter Bridge was on tour in 2008, Kennedy collaborated with former members of Led Zeppelin on an undisclosed project, though the band never fully materialized and the songs he wrote with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and Jason Bonham remain unreleased. He then started working with Slash, featuring on the guitarist''s 2010 eponymous solo album on two tracks and later serving as Slash''s vocalist on tour. With Slash, Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators have recorded two studio albums. Kennedy''s debut solo album, Year of the Tiger, was released in March 2018.

Gigi Parrish was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts as Katherine Gertrude McElroy, and raised in Hartford, Connecticut. Her mother died in 1918, and McElroy and her siblings were put up for adoption. After adoption by a wealthy family, she and her step-siblings were tutored by author Dillwyn Parrish.

Although he was eighteen years her senior, the two fell in love, and at the age of fifteen she married Parrish, under the name Gertrude McElroy. For their honeymoon, she and her husband started out on motorcycles from his family''s home in Claymont, Delaware, intending to drive across the country to California. Parrish was severely injured in an accident in the Southwestern United States and, once she was physically able, they completed the remainder of the journey via train.

In 1929, she and her husband moved permanently to California, where, a few years later, Parrish was signed to a contract with Samuel Goldwyn''s motion picture company. In 1933 she made her film debut in Roman Scandals, starring Eddie Cantor and Gloria Stuart. Parrish became a "WAMPAS Baby Star", touring the country to promote motion pictures through the Shriners sponsorship. In 1934 she appeared in secondary roles in six more films.

Gigi and Dillwyn Parrish rented a beach house in Laguna Beach, next door to Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher and her husband Alfred Fisher, with whom they became good friends. Her husband fell in love with Mary Fisher at a point when the marriage was already in difficulty. By the time both couples divorced, Parrish had already fallen in love with journalist and screenwriter John Weld (1905-2003).

After appearing in nine films, she gave up her acting career and married Weld in 1937. From 1949 to 1965 she and her husband published The Laguna Beach Post, at which time she was known as Katherine Weld.

Her husband John Weld died in 2003 in Dana Point, California, aged 98, after 66 years of marriage. Parrish died three years later, aged 93.', 'Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA', 1, '/9s7trTn9rB1XMrdo3cC3WOKlkTC.jpg'),

She recalled in a 1980 telephone conversation: "The film was in good taste; some people thought the book was trashy". Anita Loos wrote in "A Girl Like I", the first volume of her autobiography, vaudeville comic Joe Frisco telling Glynn: "Leave me get this straight. You want to find some tramp that don''t look like a tramp, to play that English tramp in your picture. But take it from me, that kind of tramp don''t hang out in Hollywood". Aileen had spent her 20s married to Charles McKenzie Pringle, the son of Sir John Pringle, a Jamaica landowner and a member of the Privy and Legislative Councils of Jamaica. Aileen lived in Jamaica until she went on stage with George Arliss. When she began divorce proceedings against Pringle in 1926, Hollywood gossip columnists speculated she would marry H.L. Mencken. She did not remarry until 1944 when she became the bride of James M. Cain, author of "The Postman Always Rings Twice". I opened my 1980 telephone conversation with Aileen by mentioning that the day before I had been reading her correspondence with Mencken at the New York Public Library. "But all the letters were destroyed", she said. I knew that Mencken had asked for all of his letters to her back at the time he became engaged to Sara Haardt. Aileen was the only woman who received such a request from Mencken at that time. "It was your letters from the late ''30s and ''40s I was reading", I told Aileen. "In one of them Mencken was urging you to write a book. Did you ever finish it?" "No. I got married instead." In a 1946 letter she wrote to Mencken. "If I had remained married to that psychotic Cain, I would be wearing a straitjacket instead of the New Look."

But before his debut as an actor, he had already debuted in 2005 as a stand-up comedian at Bungy Comedy, a Swedish club for stand-up beginners. In 2006 he enrolled at Standup Star, a stand-up school, where among others, Özz Nûjen and Jakob Öqvist, two of the most well-known comedians in Sweden, have attended.

As of 2008, his most notable appearance was in Melodifestivalen 2008, the Swedish selections for the Eurovision Song Contest. For example, he sang a song to Kristian Luuk''s  (the host) girlfriend Carina Berg. In his song he declared his love for  her. Afterward, Berg said that she had to hide her cheeks so people  couldn''t see that she was blushing.

Gustafsson gained a certain degree of international fame following a World of Warcraft (WoW) joke in Parlamentet,  talking about people wasting time on the internet and not contributing  to their party''s effort by playing inefficiently, using so much internal  WoW terminology himself that he was incomprehensible to non-players. The scene was spread over the Internet, mainly on YouTube, where translations into other languages could also be found.

In 2008, Björn received big media attention by great efforts in Parlamentet and as an entertainment in the breaks to Melodifestivalens and he also got voted as the Sweden''s funniest man by Aftonbladet''s readers on 6 March 2008. He also read the Swedish votes at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. He continued his "stand-up" shows at the big stage, in the 44th Guldbagge Awards in 2009 together with Johan Glans, and with Robert Gustafsson in the Svenska idrottsgalan 2009 (Swedish athletics awards) where he also presented the nominations for rookie of the year.', 'Kungälv, Västra Götalands län, Sweden', 1, '/3kGXilt33XTBkjF1zeMuQSDWDaU.jpg'),

Resortes, who began his career as a member of a circus, made his motion picture debut in 1946. He participated in more than 50 Mexican movies throughout his career, and he also participated in many television series. Many of his best films he made were El Rey de México (The King of Mexico), El Cartero del Barrio, Al Son del Mambo (To the Mambo''s Rhythm) and El Futbolista Fenómeno (The Phenomenal Soccer Player). But one of his most famous movies was La Niña de la Mochila Azul (The Girl With the Blue Back Pack). That movie also had a sequel, La Niña de la Mochila Azul 2 (The Girl With the Blue Back Pack 2).  Those two movies in particular became two of the largest teen movie  hits in Mexican movie history and helped Resortes gain familiarity among  the younger generations during the 1980s

audition and was for the Lead role of the ''Love Interest'' for a music 

video titled "Whoever Made Those Rules" for the Country Music Television

 network (CMT).

The producers of this video were hoping to find a

 girl to play the love interest who had similar quirky likableness to 

that of the character Amelie from the feature film "Amelie". They felt 

Julia fit the bill perfectly and cast her in the role.

Julia 

enjoyed working on this film set so much that she decided then that she 

wanted to spend the rest of her life working in the film industry! 

"Whoever Made Those Rules" went on to earn the award

 ''Most Watched Video of the Year'' and the band, that goes by the title 

"Doc Walker", have gone on to become one of Canada''s leading country 

music groups.

Sparked by a passion to learn more about the craft 

of performing, Julia began training in classical acting in Toronto. At 

the age of 18 Julia ventured overseas to further her training at leading

 drama schools in both Italy and London.

Since the completion of 

her European training, Julia has worked extensively doing touring 

theater shows, musicals, radio dramas, television &amp; film.

In 2008 Julia relocated to beautiful British Columbia.

He has also received rave reviews for his own projects, such as "The Death of Comedy" (Co-created with writer Devin McCracken) and his scientific experiments called "The Drunk Improv", which have both gone on to become underground cult hits.

Paul has studied this art form in and out of the classroom his whole life, participating in countless workshops and staging his own social experiments when he was as young as 8 years old. In 2001 he graduated from Studio 58, considered one of the finest acting programs in North America.  2006 marked the release of "Eighteen''.

Anderson Lawler (May 5, 1902 – April 6, 1959) was an American film and stage actor and producer, who had a career lasting from the 1920s through the 1950s. He began on Broadway, before moving to featured and supporting roles in Hollywood over a ten-year career at the very beginning of the talking picture era. After the end of his acting career, Lawler would move to the production end of the film industry, as well as becoming a producer of legitimate theater in the late 1940s and 1950s.

Life and career

Lawler was born Sidney Lawler on May 5, 1902 in Russellville, Alabama to Earnest H. and Dona C. Lawler. Prior to 1927, Lawler would move to New York City, and change his professional name to Anderson. In 1927 he would have a featured role in the Broadway production Her First Affaire, which premiered at the Nora Bayes Theatre in August 1927. In 1929 he would move to Los Angeles, where he would begin his career in the film industry. His first role would be in 1929''s River of Romance. While in Hollywood, he appeared in almost thirty films during this time, mostly in supporting roles, before moving behind the scenes in 1939. Aside from his professional career, he was also popular with many Hollywood luminaries, such as William Haines, George Cukor, Gary Cooper and Katharine Hepburn. Lawler was a homosexual, although he was frequently linked with women. In 1935 he accompanied Kay Francis on a trip to Europe, ostensibly sent by the studios to keep her out of trouble. At one point, Walter Winchell started a rumor that the two were engaged.

He produced the 1946 film, Somewhere in the Night, which was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and starred John Hodiak, Nancy Guild, and Lloyd Nolan. Lee Strasberg adapted the screenplay, and was an assistant director on the project. Shortly after this, both Lawler and Strasberg were transferred to the New York office of Twentieth Century-Fox. Lawler and Strasberg had a close friendship, Lawler becoming the Godfather of Strasberg''s daughter, Susan Strasberg. In New York, Lawler worked in Fox''s talent department, but he also began a second career as a producer of legitimate theater. At least one of those plays, Oh Men, Oh Women, would be turned into a film by Fox in 1957. On April 6, 1959, Lawler would die suddenly and unexpectedly from a heart attack.', 'Russellville, Alabama, USA', 1, '/c8F64qfGkvjbThxuNDNsrK5r0QF.jpg'),

Three of these shorts either won or were nominated for different awards.  Coogler''s first feature film was titled Fruitvale, and later Fruitvale Station (2013).

Dorothy Appleby (January 6, 1906 – August 9, 1990) was an American film actress. She appeared in over 50 films between 1931 and 1943.  Appleby gained early acting experience as an understudy and a chorus member in plays in New York City. A newspaper article reported that Appleby "came to New York fresh from winning a Maine beauty contest."

Appleby was seen in many supporting roles, almost always in short subjects or low-budget feature films. She never progressed to leading roles in important pictures because of her height, which made her difficult to cast The trim brunette stood just over five feet tall, and her early leading men (like comedian Charley Chase) towered over her.

She soon found steady if not prestigious work in Columbia Pictures'' two-reel comedies. She appeared frequently with The Three Stooges, who were only a few inches taller than she was, and in 1940 she became Buster Keaton''s leading lady, for the same reason: her height complemented his. She worked with Columbia comics Andy Clyde, El Brendel, and Hugh Herbert, and she had an uncredited part in John Ford''s Stagecoach.

Some of her Stooge comedies were Loco Boy Makes Good, So Long Mr. Chumps, and In the Sweet Pie and Pie. One memorable appearance was as Mexican brunette Rosita in 1940''s Cookoo Cavaliers. In the film, Appleby gets clobbered by the Stooges when a facial "mud pack" made of cement dries on her face. Her petite figure belied her age, and she continued to play "younger" roles into the 1940s. One of her last screen roles was a one-line bit (playing a college co-ed at age 35) in the 1941 Jane Withers feature Small Town Deb.', 'Portland, Maine, U.S.', 1, '/ideDTbwQN32XmVY4mx9FDhcYW4Q.jpg'),

She is perhaps most recognized for her role as Camilla Barnes in Law and Order: Criminal Intent. Proving her versatility she went against her young ingénue demeanor to play the surprise murderer opposite Vincent D''Onofrio, Margaret Colin, and Brent Spiner.  Formerly an accomplished ballet dancer, Taylor Roberts came of age in the highly disciplined dance field, performing with such companies as the Royal Ballet of London and training at the prestigious Kirov Academy of Ballet. She is a classically trained actress having received her degree from the UNCSA Theatre Conservatory. On stage she has tackled such roles as Rosalind in Shakespeare''s As You Like It, Emily in Our Town, Nastya in Gorky''s The Lower Depths, and Abigail Adams in 1776. A North Carolina girl at heart, Taylor was named for her Mother''s side of the family. The Taylors were original settlers of Carolina and Virginia, and Taylor''s grandfather was a cousin of the late actress, Dame Elizabeth Taylor.  Amid her theater training Taylor began working on the feature film, Mona Lisa Smile as a principal cast member, learning the ropes alongside Julia Roberts, Julia Stiles, Marcia Gaye Harden, Kirsten Dunst, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, under the direction of Mike Newell. Soon after, Taylor was personally invited to participate in a series of staged readings organized by Al Pacino and Patrice Chéreau. Over the span of two years Taylor contributed her talents to Betsy and Napoleon, playing the title role of Betsy to Pacino''s Napoleon. She considers these readings a highlight of her young career, working alongside Mr. Pacino, F. Murray Abraham, Scarlett Johansson, Carol Kane, Sam Rockwell, Eric Stoltz, and Bebe Neuwirth, and produced by Colleen Camp. Taylor so impressed Pacino that he personally invited her back for several readings over the years, even asking her to help him rehearse for the Merchant of Venice, reading Portia to his Shylock.  During the success of these readings the buzz started to grow. Roberts shocked many in Los Angeles when she won the part of Emily, a mentally challenged savant, after Meredith Tucker insisted on a special audition taping in New York. The role in Melissa Painter''s Admissions was a part that involved much research with the mentally challenged community. Taylor exceeded expectations giving a performance that has been reviewed as "delicate" and "spot-on." Her costars included Amy Madigan, Lauren Ambrose, Christopher Lloyd, and John Savage.  Alongside her acting career Taylor''s fashion and commercial work has paired her with various designers and companies including ESPRIT, La Senza Swimwear, Swedish TV1, Verizon, Stylehouse, Mondo Guerra, and more.

He was born in London England on December 8 1948, the middle of five children of Scottish actor, Russell Waters. As a child John often hung around film studios while dad worked and even starred in a few young parts. He first faced a live audience as a singer and bass player with 60s R &amp; R Band The Riots and appeared in Macbeth before travelling to Australia in 1968 with only a guitar and $90. He soon heard a US film called Adam''s Woman, starring Beau Bridges, was being filmed in NSW so he managed to get himself cast in a small role. Fellow cast members recommended he try auditioning for a musical. He did, and landed the lead role of Claude in Sydney''s 1969 production of the landmark rock musical, Hair. This was followed by the role of Judas in Godspell. This led to an acting career on stage, film and television that elevated him to his current status as Australia''s most versatile leading man. From the brooding Sgt. McKellar Of ABC TV''s Rush in 1974 which earned him a Logie Award for Best New Talent, through the Australian film boom that followed with films such as End Play, Summerfield, Breaker Morant, and on to the mini-series of the 80''s, All The Rivers Run, Nancy Wake and Alice To Nowhere. Not to be forgotten was his ten year stint as host of childrens ABC program PlaySchool.  John has always intrigued audiences with his diversity. Since collecting Australia''s highest accolade as the Australian Film Institute''s Best Actor Award in 1988 for the film Boulevard of Broken Dreams, John has re-embraced musical theatre as Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady, and They''re Playing Our Song, and in productions of The Hunting of the Snark for Mike Batt, and A Little Night Music for the Sydney Theatre Company. He has also appeared in Love Letters at the Sydney Opera House and Children of a Lesser God. In 1995 he appeared in ReUnion a rock musical written and financed by himself and Stewart D''Arrietta. He won unanimous acclaim in the role of Pontius Pilate in the 1992 concert version of Jesus Christ Superstar with John Farnham, Kate Ceberano, Jon Stevens and Angry Anderson which successfully toured the nation. He has made guest appearances in various TV series, including Good Guys Bad Guys, The Man From Snowy River, All Together Now and Young Lions.

Modern viewers will recognize Gittelson in her appearances in several early Three Stooges films such as Slippery Silks, Dizzy Doctors, and The Sitter Downers. Perhaps her most famous role was as Minnie in the Stooge film False Alarms, in which she played the large and man-hungry lady pursuing the affections of a reluctant Curly Howard. Curly memorably contacts Moe and Larry, saying "Hello, Moe? You''d better come over. You''re missing one of the biggest things in your life!" In this role, she also remarked, "I grow on people!"

Born in South Africa, his film career started in 1987 in the film Scavengers. He appeared in many South African movies throughout the late 1980s to the 2000s.

Wrestling career

Smith became a manager in professional wrestling in early 1997. Bret Hart visited South Africa and met Smith. Hart recommended him for a role in the World Wrestling Federation, however he never fought as a wrestler. Smith made his wrestling debut in Tennessee in the US Wrestling Association (USWA). He wrestled under the name Commandant, and managed a group of wrestlers including "Interrogator", "Tank" and "Recon" as the "Truth and Reconciliation Commission".

This tea won the USWA Tag Team Championship three times. In June 1997, the Truth Commission made their WWF debut. Smith made promos on WWF about the Truth Commission and attacking the United States for not having discipline. He was hated by the fans. "Sniper" replaced "Tank" on the commission. He was interviewed by Sunny, but scared her by yelling at her. During the summer of 1997 the group lost only to "Legion of Doom". In September, Smith was replaced by Don Callis, the "Jackyl"; the WWF wanted someone who could participate physically in the matches. Smith returned to South Africa, ending his wrestling career.

Acting

Smith appeared in 2006''s The Fall, a film about Los Angeles based in the 1920s. In 2009 he played Johan De Villers in Invictus, about a South Africa rugby team fighting to win the 1995 Rugby World Cup.

At a young age Dean learned how to channel her pain into her music, writing and channeling her emotions into songs. Creative writing served as Dean’s self-therapy, helping her cope with a hard life of poverty and bullying (inside and outside her home). Dean took to writing and singing as an escape from her small Oklahoma town with no glimpses of a positive future.

At the age of 15, Dean and her sister Deandria moved to Omaha, Nebraska; leaving her older siblings in Tulsa. The separation made Dean dig deeper for a connection, finding solace in music and the local music scene. Singing in every studio, writing for local rappers and producers, Dean unknowingly grass-rooted herself. Learning the ins and outs of her talent and creativity, at 20 years old Dean made a bold move and left Omaha with only $500 in her pocket. She drove 18 hours, alone, to Atlanta, Georgia with dreams of breaking into the music industry. She sang for anyone who would listen. While at a Gap Band concert, music producer Tricky Stewart overheard Dean singing in the crowd along with the band. He immediately asked her to set up a meeting. While going through her catalog of songs, Tricky was impressed by not only her voice but also her songwriting ability. He signed her to a small publishing deal that allowed Dean to grow and connect with other known writers and producers. This opportunity provided Dean with the tools, tricks, and skills to writing potential Top 40 songs.

Although her time with Tricky was a significant point in her career, Dean eventually parted ways and relocated to Los Angeles, California.

Upon relocating to Los Angeles, Dean began to build a name in the songwriting world. She was eventually introduced to Polow da Don, and later signed to Zone 4 Records/Interscope Records.

In 2009 Dean released her first single, "Drop It Low", which peaked at number 38 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first US Top 40 single. Dean''s big break came when she collaborated with super producers Stargate, creating her first number one single, Rihanna’s "Rude Boy". She went on to write "What''s My Name", "Where Have You Been" and several other Rihanna hits, as well as Katy Perry''s "Firework" and Nicki Minaj’s "Super Bass".

She would go on to be named ‘The Song Machine’ in John Seabrook''s The New Yorker article.

Outside of music, Dean has been able to establish herself as a voice-over talent. She landed roles in Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012) and Rio (2011).

After making a great impression in the voice-over world, Dean was asked to audition for a small part in an upcoming movie about a girl A cappella group. She jumped at the chance to audition and landed the role of Cynthia Rose in the hit movie Pitch Perfect (2012), which also lead to her co-starring in Pitch Perfect 2 (2015).', 'Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA', 1, '/3CYdS9F0qlP7DBjAh3IxbSsLOWk.jpg'),
