        (1394359, 'Nathan Geist', '1986-08-16', 'Nathaniel Adam Joseph Danger Geist was born on August 16, 1986 in the Chicagoland area. At the age of five, "Danger" knew that he wanted to be a Film &amp; Television actor and has refused to lose sight of that dream. Throughout high school, Danger intensely studied theatre and was the only student in his class of 500 students who partook in every high school theatrical production.

When Danger arrived to college in 2005, he enrolled in the Theatre &amp; Dance Department to study acting in an attempt to pursue his dream. However, it wasn''t but a few weeks into his first semester that he realized a few disappointments: for one, he was interested in Film &amp; Television acting, but the acting program he was enrolled in only offered Theatre lessons. Secondly, even if Danger graduated with a degree in Theatre, he would have no career opportunities and limited skill sets in the event that he failed to obtain job opportunities. And thirdly, he would have very little to offer the Film &amp; Television world as all his training would be focused on theatrical acting.

Danger knew he had a few options. He could drop out and move to Los Angeles to audition and probably fail because he had limited Film &amp; Television experience, or he could submerge himself in a lifestyle that would make him well-rounded and more interesting than just another fresh-out-of-college Theatre Major.

Danger''s philosophy was that if he focused first on his development as a person, and only thereafter focused on his career as an actor, he''d significantly increase his likelihood of achieving his dream. Graduating from university in 2010, Danger hoped his Bachelor''s Degree in Psychology would help him further understand the human condition which would, in turn, offer him insight into any roles he landed. By the time he graduated, Danger was a decorated war veteran for a year-long combat tour spent in Afghanistan as a soldier in the U.S. Army, he was a published author and was concurrently working on three literary projects for future publication, and he already had credited roles in both film and television.

Danger''s philosophy to succeeding in the acting business has yet to prove more successful than the standard approach of moving to high-market areas and begin auditioning. However, if Danger''s dream of becoming a credible Film &amp; Television actor is ever slashed, at least he will not be just another statistic who went to achieve his dreams and wound up empty-handed in the end.

Pandora''s first exposure to street dancing happened while attending Santa Ana''s Saddleback High School during her ''94/''95 freshmen year where music was frequently played during lunch breaks. Often at those times students would come out to break or pop in the schools central "Quad" area.

However, it wasn''t until her Los Angeles city night life during the late 90''s that Pandora became surrounded with an array of street style dances &amp; fell in love with Poppin''. Through that environment, she met &amp; befriended some local Poppers &amp; began to run with them under the name "The Funk Technicians". It was through this group of dancers that she was introduced to the traditional side of Poppin'' &amp; attended her first big street dance event, "Freestyle Session" in the year 2000. It was at this event that she saw &amp; met many of California''s most notorious old school street dancers for the first time. Many practicing nights &amp; days later, Pandora was recruited into what was already a widely recognized Poppin'' crew known as the "Animated Beat Mechanics" (ABM). From this point forward, Pandora realized dancing wasn''t just something she did only for fun, but that it had become her "way of life". Pandora immediately began to practice even harder eventually building up her reputation by battling &amp; competing against some of the best dancers on the globe.

Pandora has since traveled throughout the US, Europe, Japan, &amp; Canada, taken 1st place at dance competitions such as "Radiotron", "How Tha West Was Won", &amp; the UK''s festival for women in Hip-Hop: "BSupreme" in London, was presented with an award for "Outstanding Popping Skills" at the Los Angeles "Hip-Hop Dance Awards", was featured on "Soul Train", received a standing ovation on Fox 11''s "So You Think You Can Dance", appeared on KJLA''s "The Hip-Hop Show", &amp; danced in music videos such as Egyptian Lover''s "Keep It Hot".

Today, Pandora showcases alongside some of the best dancers in the industry on stages such as The Carnival "Choreographers Ball" in Hollywood, speaks on dance discussion panels, judges dance competitions, shares her knowledge of Poppin'' as a workshop instructor, &amp; has moved on from ABM to co-create an all female street dance squad called "Venus Fly Trap", a female crew specializing in all areas of street dance such as Poppin'', Lockin'', Breakin'', &amp; Housin''.

Growing even more in skill level &amp; professionalism, Pandora is currently focused on pursuing careers in both dance &amp; design as she continues to hold it down in battles, shows &amp; jams across the world.

In the 1930s he started out on the Broadway stage appearing in various musicals which lasted until the early 1940s. Then like many Broadway actors and dancers, he seemingly drifted his way to Hollywood where he was able to use his talents as a dancer to appear in many party scenes in a suit dancing in some of the most well known films.

Like many dancers though, that was only part of their work as they could not survive on musicals alone and by the mid 1950s musicals started to lose their popularity so he had to find work elsewhere He was never unemployed long.

Alton''s appearance was ideal for bankers, or distinguished townsman, or whatever was needed. By the late 1950s, he was able to secure some roles in which he received screen credit in shows like Bat Masterson, Tombstone Territory, and Lock-Up all while still appearing at the usual party scenes or the social gatherings.

By the 1960s his career was still going strong as he still found work in the usual places and managed to appear in several well known movies like True Grit, The Cheyenne Social Club, and Airport and appearing in most of the well known television shows of the time.

His career wound down by the 1970s and while his name won''t garner the attention or recognition to film audiences of today, most casting directors could tell you it was a name that should be respected and could be depended on.', 'New York - USA', 1, '/nAijK3a88g91iEtPSwgh1SCuA46.jpg'),

His introduction to theater came when his drama teacher at Midwood High School got him involved in “Sing,” a NYC high school performance program. However his early career was in education and child care, first teaching at three Brooklyn public schools & subsequently directing a Chinatown day care center for 6 years.

His interest in theater did not wane, and opportunity presented itself later when he was invited to join the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre Company. During this time he perfomed in numerous productions, including “Yellow Fever,” where he played the role of Chuck Chan.

Meanwhile, he also was developing experience in film. His first SAG job was in the movie “Eyewitness." This led to a number of small roles in other films, until he landed a more significant role in “The Last Dragon” which has since become a cult classic. Roles since then have included General Tan in Martin Scorsese’s “Kundun,” and Sung Yon Kim in the “Sopranos."

Henry has a warm personality with a keen sense of humor, which can be subtle and cerebral or antic and physical. At the same time he is quite adept at dramatic and more sensitive roles. Henry speaks Cantonese and Toisanese dialect. While he speaks perfect American English, he has also played roles with Asian accents. His credits include voiceovers and narration.

Sope cultivated her acting chops in the UK, primarily Shakespearean stage plays, certified by the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA) and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA).

As an extended artistic expression to her acting, Sope studied various forms of dance, including Balinese and African dance. She had the privilege of performing the world famous South African "Ipi Tombi" dance at the National Arts Theater in Nigeria.

A lover of education, Sope obtained an undergraduate degree in Engineering and Master''s degree in Marketing.

He began studying voice in his last year of high school, and after graduation, attended Wright Jr. College, majoring in music. During the summer break after his freshman year, he took an acting workshop at Columbia College and got hooked on the challenge of acting. So the following fall, instead of returning to college, he enrolled as a full-time student at the prestigious, Goodman Theater School of Drama, the Theater Arts arm of the Chicago Art Institute. Following Goodman, he volunteered for the draft and served a hitch in the U.S. Army, stationed in Germany. Upon full-filling his tour of duty, he moved to New York City, taking up residence in Manhattan, and resumed his studies at the HB Studio, studying first with Herbert Berghof, and then with Uta Hagen. While working at various survival jobs as he attended acting classes, he also continued to study voice, and also began dance training, starting jazz dance with Matt Mattox and soon after, classical ballet at the Ballet Russe.When the summers came around, he would interrupt his training by leaving town to work in summer stock, then return to the city in the fall and resumed his pursuits. After only a year and a half of an intense training schedule, and desperate for a job in a show, he gave a go at his first Equity dance audition and won the gig. After relocating to California, he was dancing in an Equity musical comedy stage show within a month after he arrived in Hollywood, and continued to perform in shows for the first year and a half, all the while continuing his training between shows at the American School of Dance, until he was signed by a top commercial and modeling agency and immediately began to work in TV commercials and print. With auditions, fittings and bookings, there was hardly enough convenient time to continue to go to dance class regularly, so he withdrew from the discipline and quit dancing. He focused instead on the much more lucrative activity of working in advertising media. At the same time however, he concentrated again on his singing, starting with performing at the, Horn, in Santa Monica, a nightclub venue that was to singers, what the various comedy clubs are to stand-up comedians, a place to try material and perform in a club environment. He also continued with acting classes, studying with Estell Harman and then with Stella Adler every summer that she would come out from New York to teach her master class in Los Angeles. During other times he studied acting with Kenneth McMillan, musical scene study with Charles Nelson Reilly and audition presentation with David Craig, and continued voice training with various teachers and coaches. In his late thirties, as a personal challenge to see what sort of shape he could get back into, he returned to jazz dance classes at the Roland Dupre'' dance facility and gave it a go for about a year, until the reality of diminished capacity convinced him to put his dance bag away for good. Also, by then he was working as an actor in all venues of media. Presently, he is semi-retired and lives in the Cahuenga Pass area of the Hollywood Hills.  - IMDb Mini Biography', 'Chicago - Illinois - USA', 1, NULL),

As a teenager he moved  to the United States and got the opportunity to go to college to study  business administration. Once in college he enrolled in an intro to  acting class and that''s where his childhood dream of being an actor was  reawakened. After that intro to acting class and with much excitement  and fear Erick changed his major to acting. A few years later Erick  received his Bachelor''s in Fine Arts degree in theater performance from  the University of Maryland Baltimore County.

Before pursuing  acting for the camera Erick had the opportunity to perform for the  stage. Some of his favorite roles include Valentin in The Kiss of the  Spider Woman, and Marmeladov in an original production of Crime &amp;  Punishment. Some notable television credits include Eastbound &amp;  Down, The Bridge, Back in The Game and Southland.

Graf specializes in short films dealing with transgender issues in an effort to normalize queer and trans experiences to a wider, more mainstream audience. Many of Graf’s films emphasize the daily lived experiences of trans men.

According to Graf, he was vocal from a young age about his knowledge of being a boy, despite being raised and treated as a girl. Feeling that he was missing parts that other boys had, Graf felt isolated and reclusive as a child. Around the age of puberty, Graf learned to keep these feelings to himself, until eventually beginning the process of transitioning at 28 years old.

Graf''s first work within the industry was a screenplay dealing with his experiences in making a female to male transition. Short films such as X-WHY (2011), Brace (2015), and Chance (2015) have given the film director a way to open up about his sexual identity by explaining what it was like to go through the process of being a transgender individual.

Jake Graf and his wife, Hannah Winterbourne, announced their engagement in 2017 after Graf proposed in New York City. Winterbourne is an engineer with the British Army and currently is the highest ranking transgender officer. The couple has expressed interest in having children, and will likely do so through surrogacy.

He was first intrigued by the paranormal after learning about electronic voice phenomena (EVP). Having many years of experience in music and a solid understanding of sound in general, his curiosity led him to investigate and capture EVPs for himself. Amazed at what he captured on his own, Billy soon started his own paranormal group with some friends named: The Las Vegas Paranormal Investigations of Mysterious Phenomena Squad (or P.I.M.P.S. for short).

Billy''s fascination with the paranormal field grew stronger and soon after he met Zak Bagans. Zak & Billy became good friends and after sharing details of his most recent audio captures Zak invited Billy to review some audio evidence for the show. After doing so, Billy was then employed to review all audio evidence for every episode.

Billy soon became very busy with the crew handling a multitude of tasks behind the camera as well as in front of it, from evidence review to gear preparation. Billy is now officially an investigator on the show. He considers himself to be a "skeptical-believer" after having many personal experiences since joining the crew.

Born in Willesden in Middlesex, England, Tarr got his first acting role in the 1973 Carry On film  Carry On Girls where he played a bearded audience member. This was followed by appearances in many television series such as Doctor Who, Blake’s 7, Space 1999, Are You Being Served?, The Gentle Touch, The Comic Strip Presents: 5 Go Mad in Dorset and Dramarama. He also notched up a number of film appearances including A View To A Kill, Eat the Rich (he also cameos in Motorhead’s music video soundtrack of the film) and Willow. However, it is his role as Big Ron in the BBC soap opera Eastenders that Tarr is best remembered.  He played the friendly ducking and diving market trader Big Ron from the show’s inception in 1985 to just before his untimely death from cancer at the age of 60 in October 1997. Although he was only a supporting actor and therefore his character had very few central storylines, he was often seen interacting with the main characters in the show who could always rely on his physically intimidating presence whenever trouble was brewing. After his death, he appeared in pre-recorded episodes of the soap. To explain the absence of his character, in early 1998 Big Ron was written out of the series in a storyline concerning him winning the lottery and moving to Spain.', 'Willesden, Middlesex, England, UK', 1, '/iMSzEgb5VCREfDQjtxo9cI0wYt5.jpg'),

Shail appeared in the 1980 series The Further Adventures of Oliver Twist and also played Oscar Drill in Shock Treatment the 1981 follow-up to The Rocky Horror Picture Show and as Guy Raines in the 1983 BBC production Johnny Jarvis. He wrote the original songs and theme music for this production, for which he received a nomination for the Ivor Novello Awards. In 1988, Shail appeared as the tough pimp "Billy White" in the TV mini-series of Jack the Ripper, starring Michael Caine. He has also made appearances in the TV series The Bill and in Casualty and The Professionals.

In 1995 Shail began working with music production company Natural Sound Source in London, producing music for television, film and advertising. In 2004 he produced the Arabic fusion album Infinity in Dubai.

In 2010 Shail was back in the recording studio working on his  autobiographical self-penned album ''Daze Like This.'' A collection of new  songs interspersed with some re-workings of some Johnny Jarvis  themes. The album received critical success, but failed to reach a wider  audience mainly due to Shails reluctance to embrace the new ''download''  generation.

Il fait ses premières armes dans la compagnie de danse hip-hop Exprime au Centre national de danse contemporaine.

Sa passion pour la scène, il la partage également en donnant des cours d’expressions théâtrale dans des lycées ou lors d’interventions dans des maisons d''arrêt.  Par ailleurs, pendant cinq ans, il a formé des enseignants au Maroc, en Tunisie et au Mali dans le cadre de programmes d’apprentissage de la langue à travers l’expression théâtrale.

À 22 ans, il quitte sa région natale et se rend à Paris où il commence sa carrière de comédien.  Il rejoint alors la compagnie Entrées de Jeu dirigée par Bernard Grosjean.  Pendant 10 ans, le théâtre forum lui permettra d’aborder de nombreux thèmes liés à l’observation de la société et il y développera l’art de l’improvisation.

Parallèlement, il fait des apparitions dans des comédies au cinéma.  C''est lors du tournage de Bambou que Didier Bourdon lui a conseillé de s’orienter vers le one-man-show.  Après un seul en scène autobiographique, Entre fous émois, il présente son premier one-man-show, Atypique en 2013, joué dans un premier temps à l''Instinct Théâtre puis à la Comédie des Boulevards et au Trévise, outre une tournée à travers la France.

She has worked on some of the most prestigious stages in Southern California.  The LA Weekly theatre critic said of her performance in Chay Yew’s adaptation of The Cherry Orchard, “I can not remember anything in theatre as heartbreaking…Pan’s eyes are glistening pieces of obsidian and her wounded silence is unbearable.”  Elizabeth originated the lead role of Chinadoll in Damon Chua’s “Film Chinois” which won the 2007 Ovation Award for Best New Play.  Elizabeth currently works extensively in film, television, stage, commercials and voiceovers.  You have seen her in guest star and co-star roles on FOX, NBC, ABC and CBS.

She reprises the role as Samantha Hobbs in Fast 8 (2017).

From her mother''s side, Eden''s Filipina heritage is mixed with Spanish and Portuguese. From her father''s side, Eden has Irish, German, British, French and Scottish ancestry, with Eden''s European lineage tracing back to the Salisbury''s and notably, the O''Baoigheallains; as epitomized in O''Dugals 14th century poem of the "blue-eyed, bold kings of Dartry!''

Eden began her acting career in 2013. She is represented by agent, Robin Nassif of Media Artists Group and manager, Tina Treadwell of Treadwell Entertainment Group and attorney Steve Younger of ''Myman Greenspan Fineman Fox Rosenberg Light [us]''.

Kim began his career in the North Korean leadership in 1968 as the head of the state’s propaganda and agitation department, the main organ of which was the film studios. He amassed arguably the world’s largest personal film collection: over 20,000 bootlegged 35mm screening copies from all around the world that, due to the DPRK’s stringent information-control policies, he was the only person in the country authorised to watch.

His first mission was to use cinema as a propaganda tool to “educate” the people. Before 1945, North Korea hadn’t existed; Korea had been a unified kingdom for hundreds of years – until 1910, when it was swallowed up by the Japanese empire, which didn’t divide it. The border that now separates the two Korean states was drawn on a map at the end of the second world war as a compromise between the US and the USSR, who had jointly defeated the Japanese. The Kims’ mandate, from the first, was to convince the people that “their” Korea in the north was more legitimate than the “other” Korea in the south, which, they said, had a puppet government secretly run by Americans. Using books and plays, but mainly film, the Kims rewrote Korean history to paint themselves as revolutionary freedom-fighters, the last bastion of resistance against Yankee imperialism.', 'Mangyongdae, North Korea', 1, '/3ts5uFsAODlL8XdBAEkrVDAZFni.jpg'),

Gregory M. Brown was born in Irvington, New Jersey to Warren John Brown, a stage actor, singer, and musician who was performing at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey and Nell Joyce (Garlick) Brown, who at the time was a housewife. His mother would eventually become the first female member of the Stock Transfer Agents Association in New York while a manager at Union Pacific Corporation. Greg is the oldest of three children. He has a sister, Suzanne Tara (Brown) Jordan and brother, David Patrick Brown.

At the age of six, his parents divorced after thirteen years of marriage. His mother, Greg and his siblings moved in with his mother''s parents in Paterson, New Jersey where Greg grew up. Greg attended Eastside High School, known for the movie Lean on Me with Morgan Freeman. Greg graduated high school in 1966 and remained in Paterson until his enlistment in the U.S. Navy in November 1967. In 1968, Greg did a tour in Vietnam aboard the USS Steinaker (DD-863) a Navy destroyer and deployed on two other cruises to the Caribbean and North Atlantic respectively before being transferred to Fighter Squadron 101 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Greg had a niche for electronics and the evolving computer industry, learning computer programming while still in the Navy. Upon separation from active duty in 1971, he started to work on Wall Street in the information technology field where he remained for the most part until his retirement as a Vice President from J.P. Morgan Chase in 2005.

As a teenager, Greg enjoyed performing in church and school plays but did not pursue the acting profession because of the divorce of his parents. His mother didn''t approve, so, out of respect for his mother he waited until he was 59 years old and after his retirement from J.P. Morgan Chase and the military.

In his short time as an actor, 2008-16 have been great years for Greg. He has performed more than 45 shorts, Ads, TV, and full feature films to date.

Greg completed shooting Stephen King''s "Willa", released in 2012 as the character Henry Lander with Clayton Watson.

Two of the films that Greg has been in recently have won various awards at film festivals across the country. One film being Rick Alverson''s film "The Comedy (2012)" with Tim Heidecker and the other is Sloan Copeland''s "Wet Behind The Ears (2013)" with Maggie Williams.

Greg completed shooting "Deep Water" in Alaska and is scheduled to be released as a short later in 2013.

Recently completed filming the Indie film "Stuff (2015)" with Yvonne Jung and Karen Sillas as Grandpa.

Chaunty''s career began online as a model in 2011 with photographer Prishan Pandithage (a known photographer based out of NY, NY).  She then worked with other locally and nationally well-known photographers.  

Spillane posted often much of her modeling (which was received well) reportedly on social platforms such as Facebook (where she is now Verified), Twitter, Instagram (where Spillane has the most followers collectively), YouTube as well as the now deceased application ''Vine'', her online "social presence" began to grow .  For instance, Chaunty made a video on Vine in 2013, it went viral and ended up in a Buzz Feed article.  Her account totaled to over 5.1 million views.

Chaunty then moved onto acting by starring in indie film "Killing Khan" and moved on to do some minor background roles appearing in Blockbuster films such as "Ted 2", "Ghostbusters 2016", "Black Mass"etc.  The rest can be found on her IMDb (Internet Movie Data Base) resume in the reference sources below. 

On the covers of Bikini magazine and Tease magazine, Spillane was featured as the cover girl in 2013-2015 four times.

Most notably Chaunty was the photo double of Debra Messing (The Mysteries of Laura 2014), Lana Del Ray (Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll 2015), LA rising actress Bess Rous (Ghostbusters 2016) as well as the character Bess Rous and Chaunty Spillane both portrayed in Ghostbusters 2016''s main female ghost character "Gertrude Aldridge"--the ghost that spewed ectoplasm all over Kristen Wiig. Spillane was part of the image of the ghost and was the portrait behind the ghost and in the mansion that is shown many times throughout the film.

On Wikipedia talk pages, Chaunty Spillane became a controversial topic due to her involvement in Ghostbusters 2016.  Controversial apparently because she was stating on social media that she was the ghost "Gertrude Aldridge" along with Bess Rous while IMDb was slow to clearly/accurately credit the ghost (including Spillane''s involvement) when the movie was initially released.

Most recently, Chaunty has moved on to filmmaking and starring in her film "Cancombe Lady Comedy Improv Sketch 2018".  She founded a production company surrounding her first production.

Born in Sweden on May 11, 1990 and raised in a small village 10 minutes outside of Stockholm , where she had played soccer. She was discovered by an agent when she was 14 years old at an outside concert. However, it was not until six years later that she decided to accept the proposal. Before making the decision, she was studying law.

Her name appeared in all media in 2012 when she posed with her partner at that time, the well-known androgynous model, Andrej Pejic.

She''s known for working hard as a male model and her versatility. Thanks to that, she has become one of the most famous ''tomboy'' girls in the current world of fashion.

In addition, her resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kristen Stewart[6] has not gone unnoticed. In 2011, she starred in a photo shoot for the magazine Candy, characterized as the actor in his youth. That was the first time that Erika Linder left his native Stockholm in the name of fashion to pose in the heart of Paris. The report was a success and her name began to haunt the editors of some of the most avant-garde magazines. Since then, she has been portrayed to the Italian edition of Vogue, V, Hair, Cover, Forward, Oyster or Muse . She has also been in several gateways of Los Angeles, New York or Australia.

Nevertheless, she describes this activity as one more thing of what she does and not as her main dedication.', 'Stockholm,  Sweden', 2, '/kuHbhuXrkbpTeVQBibKSxAGEpPU.jpg'),

A German-born New York native, Zazie was raised between Washington Heights and Berlin, speaking both German and English with her family at home. She received training from the Harlem School of the Arts and LaGuardia Arts Highschool, but took time to study French, feel fancy, and live in Paris during her time at Skidmore College. Theater continued to live alongside her love for language and travel, so upon graduating in 2013, she decided to muster up her courage and pursue a career in performing.

Living in Harlem now, she has since had the opportunity to work on various New York films and is happy to find herself on diverse sets, with all kinds of colorful people- navigating her way as a working actress. She has studied with Will Bond and Gameela Wright, collaborated with director Bart Freundlich, and will be starring in Donald Glover’s upcoming television series!

Afterwards, Kathryn continued her journey through her extensive "film and television" studies in London, England which later branched out to Melbourne, Australia. She is known for being a dynamic, high energy and devoted actress who immerses herself entirely into any variety of roles she plays; assisted by her Indian/Italian/Germanic heritage.

More over, her on-screen presence has been described by Producers as nothing short of electric. Recently, she shared screen-time with Matt Damon in ''Downsizing'' and has been recognized internationally for her role as Samira in ''Petrol''. She produced and starred as the lead in the theatre production ''Vigils'' by renowned playwright Noah Haidle, which opened to industry acclaim at its Canadian Premiere this year.

Her drive and desire to not only take her industry by storm through acting, producing and directing but to continue to fuel her spiritual and nurturing side of helping others is what truly sets her apart from others in her field.

Kathryn''s future pursuits include utilizing the global network that she has established to create a more egalitarian and nurturing world through the magic of honest and purposeful storytelling.

Her real name was Patricia Marie. Her father was a Greek Catholic immigrant and her mother a Lutheran from Norway who ran the pure food café, a Greek café in Minneapolis which was located adjacent to the Orpheum Theater. Her sisters were Lavern Sophie born July 6, 1911, died 1967 (cancer); Maxene Angelyn born Jan. 3, 1916, died October 1995 of a heart attack while on vacation at Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Peter Andrews did not think it honorable to have his daughters in show business and decided they should go back to school and become secretaries. Maxine was only four when she first appeared on her first radio broadcast in Minneapolis. By the time she was six she was entertaining at veterans hospitals, for the Mayor of Minneapolis and at Daughters of American Revolution luncheons. Laverne started the trio of sisters and they appeared in kiddie revues on local radio stations and at the Orpheum in their hometown of Minneapolis. It was there they were discovered by Larry Rich, who offered them a job with his traveling revue. Patty was only ten at the time. They began their career in New York city with Jack Belasco''s orchestra and later with Ted Mack making the Vaudeville circuit. In 1937 they were heard by recording executive, Dave Kapp and they began a long association with a string of hits. In 1953, the group broke up with Laverne going to New York to study dramatics. Laverne became a career housewife and Patti stayed in show business as a single after their hopes and ambitions clashed with one another. In 1956 they regrouped and sang in Las Vegas at the Flamingo Hotel along with a host of TV offers and a new Capitol recording contract. Their first major hit was "Bei Mir Bist Du Schon", was very well liked by Nazi Germany, until the discovery that the songwriters were a Jewish race. Other top hits included "Don''t Fence Me In", "Apple Blossom Time", "Rum and Coca Cola", and "I Can Dream, Can''t I?", in 1937.', 'Mound, Minnestota', 1, '/dnAUY3ZvvnJ3fua12husVQ4mDFE.jpg'),

She was born in Whittier, California on December 6, 1990 and raised in Chino Hills, California. She is a multi-racial but primarily Spanish and Native American blood with heavy traces from Northern & Eastern Europe. She is an English speaker studying Spanish and Japanese.

Ren''s career pursuits began at the age of 13, when she attended her first theater class at Robert O. Townsend Junior High School. She graduated Ruben S. Ayala High School in 2009 with over a dozen awards from the school''s drama department, including "Most Inspirational" two years in a row and the first ''Lifetime Achievement Award'' in the history of the school''s program, founded in her honor.

The Thespian Arts Theatre Festival she founded her senior year continues, annually to this date, at her alma matter and inspired other departments, campus-wide, to celebrate talent shows of their own.

The Academy alumni includes Morgan Freeman, Mark Hamill, Cindy Williams and Donna Reed. During Aranda''s attendance there, she won national recognition when presented with the "Outstanding Performance by an Actress" Award at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for her role as "Willie The Space Freak" in a gender-bended adaptation of Sam Shepard''s, "The Unseen Hand". She was flown from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. to be honored February of 2012. There were only two recipients of this first annual award, nationwide. She shaved her head for the role and was credited for this in BuzzFeed Community article, "17 Trail-Blazing Bald Beauties In Hollywood", listed among the likes of Persis Khambatta, Angelina Jolie-Pitt, Natalie Portman, Ellen Page and more.

Aranda gained furhter notability in the Entertainment Industry early in her movie career for her producer role in five back-to-back feature films under Plus Entertainment, commissioned for Spanish Television Network, Cinelatino, in 2014. During production, a partnership with Hollywood TV Cops and Hollywood & Vine Talent Casting developed, out of which she landed her most notable roles across feature films, music videos and television shows.

She founded her production company, Starpark Studios, in 2008 and made it LLC in 2013.

It was at school here that he first developed a love for acting and drama through the influences of some of his teachers. At 13 he began attending St Peter''s School, York and it was here that his sporting prowess as a cricketer came to the fore playing alongside now England cricketer Jonny Bairstow.

Leaving school at 18 with a hand full of A-levels, James then spent time working in York in order to save for his time in Vancouver, B.C, Canada. Whilst he spent several months in, what he believes to be, the nicest cities he has ever had the opportunity to visit, his acting took a hiatus as uncertainty and settled on him in terms of career path choices.

Upon return from North America, James began studying Politics and Sociology at Newcastle University. It was here that acting really took over and the decision was made that it was the only career that he could seriously consider taking on. Being a large and active part of theatre and comedy societies where he was successful winning awards and ultimately sitting on the executive committee.

Having graduated in 2013 he then embarked upon his chosen path, but deciding not to attend drama school due to the financial implication of such a venture. In going about it ''the old fashioned way'' and learning on the job, a clear progression can be seen in his screen work as he continually looks more and more comfortable on screen. ''Eveline'' was reasonably well received, but James himself has commented on his try-hard acting. More recently in ''Father Figure'' he has been able to maintain character much more strongly and with his newest work in ''Acheron'', ''Switch'', ''The Jeweller'' and ''Chloe'' he has been going from strength to strength.  - IMDb Mini Biography By: Lauren Green', 'York, Yorkshire, England', 1, '/8T5HuTRsF87sePsQAYfUiIdp3ye.jpg'),

A cinema lover, inspired by a variety of staple films from the past, he started to devote his time to his true passions: writing, directing and acting. He began studying Meisner technique at the William Esper Studio in New York, and later with Anthony Abeson. In a short period of time Guillaume ended up working under the direction of Academy Award winner Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki and David Fincher, acted along such household names as Eva Longoria and Jane Fonda, and twice collaborated with the David Lynch Foundation, even receiving this compliment from David Lynch himself: "Guillaume, you are a great actor". After directing several Music Videos and Short Films, and writing several spec scripts (one of them awarded by Francis Ford Coppola himself), this refreshingly interesting, funny and charming auteur, reminiscent of a young Alain Delon, wrote, directed, produced and acted in Devils in Disguise, his first feature film, in a spirit of a true Renaissance man.

David and his best friends wrote and performed SNL style sketches, touring the local club scene in Providence, RI. From there, David moved to Los Angeles, embarking on the path to a professional career. He was accepted to the University of Southern California, where he lived off-campus in the Delta Chi fraternity house. He completed his college curriculum during the day, followed by acting classes at night. His mentors included the likes of Janet Alhanti, Margie Haber, and Ivana Chubbuck. Their training led to many smaller roles in independent productions. But it wasn''t until his move to The South when David''s career really started gaining traction. His first major network production was an episode of House Of Cards, playing Buha - press secretary to Joel Kinnaman - in an episode directed by Robin Wright. This led to more television gigs, such as The Gifted, Lodge 49, The Originals, and many others. From there, David began entering the world of feature films, with a supporting role in Gemini Man, directed by the Oscar-winning director Ang Lee. Currently, he continues to act in both mediums. While not working, David is involved with local charitable pursuits, such as using ''improv as therapy'' to children with behavioral complications.

Her mother is a former college professor of ethics, esthetics and the Russian language, who instilled in Olga a taste for arts, fashion and European sophistication. Olga’s father was an electronics engineer and a computer scientist who wore Levi’s jeans, owned a collection of The Beatles'' records, and passed his sense of humor on to Olga and her younger brother Dzmitry. During her years in Belarus, Olga studied arts and languages and was on her high school’s swim team. She started studying English at the age of six. When she was nine, she was among the first children from Belarus to go abroad and spend a year living with a host family in Ireland. That’s where she was first introduced to theater at a local school. She recalls with laughter that her first lines, "From Prince? Ahhh! Give it to me!" were delivered in an Irish accent at the school''s Cinderella production. But it wasn’t until Olga won a merit-based scholarship to attend Minsk State Linguistic University that she tried her performing skills on stage again. In college, Olga joined the "KVN" comedy club and became a comedy show host for two years. Her self-made character was a sexy-geeky student of linguistics, and her seductive manner of delivering jokes was infamously copied throughout college.

        (1759548, 'Davide Tucci', '1987-09-14', 'Davide Tucci was born on 14th September 1987 in Isola Del Liri (FR), later his family moved to the exotic Maltese Islands. Attending St Aloysius College, he developed a love for being a creative, which was followed by studying software and web design. Having always felt the urge to perform and entertain from a young age, Davide drew his inspiration from the actors, singers and public figures throughout his upbringing.

Singing was always Davide’s passion and helped him break into the industry. His first role was in the hit musical “Spring Awakening” (2010) at St James Theatre as Georg. A successful run of the award winning show confirmed his love for the arts, as well as launched him unexpectedly into  a modeling career.

“La Famiglia” (2011) the Maltese television crime drama was Davide’s first small screen role, portraying Valentino Saraceni. Later in 2012 he was involved in the very successful prime-time TVM (Television Malta) series “Katrina” (2012- 14) where he played the role of the visually impaired Clyde Montaldo, who was received warmly by the audience. Also taking on roles in theatre such as, “Jiena Nhobb, Inti Thobb” (2014) an original Maltese play by Simon Bartolo that deals with sexuality, religion and morality - in which Davide plays the controversial role of Devin. Later that year, he also worked in the Maltese/ Canadian eOne production of “A Dangerous Arrangement” (2015), working alongside actors such as Colm Meaney and Deborah Kara Unger. This film saw Davide take on the character of Tommaso - a young farmer working for the wealthy Vreeland family, who saves his co-star from drowning and deals with a father looking for vengeance.

In 2015, Davide starred in TVM most watched prime-time television programme, ‘Ic-Caqqufa’ (2015- 16), he played the role of Alex, a loner who finds refuge from the materialism of society with his love for horses. Also on the stage, ‘Faith, Hope and Charity’ (2015), set in Second World War Malta has seen Davide portraying the injured Italian pilot Francesco Cavalli, who after an emergency landing, falls in love with the nurse who takes care of him.

The following year, he took on the role of John in “Limestone Cowboy” (2016), who goes through a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the film, as he is torn between the relationship with his delusional father and that of his growing child as a single parent. This role allowed him to feature in a film that truly showed off Malta’s home grown cultural aspect. An on-going demand in theatre has seen him undertake a role in Malcolm Gelea’s “Marti Martek, Martek Marti” - a theatrical sex-comedy, where Davide portrays a cocky, sexually adventurous Owen, then dove straight into the iconic Demetrius, an arrogant, self-centred youth, who then falls in love with the woman he initially despises in William Shakespeare''s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (2016), performed in the presidential gardens of San Anton in honour of William Shakespeare’s 400th anniversary from his death.

Between projects he loves travelling, adventuring, horse riding and enjoys any kind of sport and cooking. Davide works in English, Maltese and Italian.', 'Sora, Frosinone, Lazio, Italy', 1, '/sr3M8suVcRlPyIPIeYywgR6lVRg.jpg'),
