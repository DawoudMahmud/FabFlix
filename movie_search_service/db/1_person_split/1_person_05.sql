Lola Jean Albright (born July 20, 1925, Akron, Ohio) was an American singer and actress.

Albright worked as a model before moving to Hollywood. She began her motion picture career with a bit part in the 1948 film The Pirate, and followed it with an important role in the acclaimed 1949 hit Champion. For the next ten years, she appeared in secondary roles in over twenty films, including several ''B'' Westerns. Albright also acted in guest roles on several television series.

In 1958, she won the role of Edie Hart on Peter Gunn, a television detective series produced by Blake Edwards and directed by Robert Altman, with the theme music that made Henry Mancini famous. Albright played a nightclub singer who was the romantic interest of Peter Gunn, played by Craig Stevens. In 1959 she was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress (Continuing Character) in a Dramatic Series. Her role required singing and led to the 1957 release of her music album Lola Wants You, as well as her album 1959 Dreamsville, in which her songs were accompanied by Henry Mancini and his orchestra.

Albright''s popularity led to several major film roles, including Elvis Presley''s 1962 film, Kid Galahad; the 1964 French film Les Felins by director René Clément; and the epic western The Way West.

Later in 1964 she appeared as Duff Daniels in the episode "Sticks and Stones Can Break My Bones" with her former Peter Gunn co-star Craig Stevens in his short-lived CBS drama Mr. Broadway.

In 1966, she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress award at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival for her role in Lord Love a Duck.

In 1968, Albright appeared in The Impossible Years, with David Niven and Christina Ferrare, and in Where Were You When the Lights Went Out? with Doris Day. She also appeared in the NBC medical drama The Eleventh Hour.

Albright temporarily replaced Dorothy Malone as Constance Mackenzie on the hit primetime soap opera Peyton Place, when Malone had to undergo emergency surgery. Albright continued to perform both in films and as a television guest actor until her retirement in the early 1980s.

Calvet made her debut in French radio, stage plays and cinema in the 1940s before being brought to Hollywood in the 1940s by producer Hal B. Wallis. He cast her in Rope of Sand (1949) opposite Burt Lancaster and Paul Henreid.

In the 1950s, Calvet appeared in a string of films, usually playing French characters, opposite such leading men as Danny Kaye (On the Riviera), Joseph Cotten (Peking Express), Dan Dailey (When Willie Comes Marching Home), James Cagney (What Price Glory?), James Stewart (The Far Country), Alan Ladd (Thunder in the East), Tony Curtis (So This Is Paris) and twice with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis (My Friend Irma Goes West and Sailor Beware).

She made a rare television appearance on the Colgate Comedy Hour with Donald O''Connor on February 3, 1952, televised nationwide by NBC.

Upset with her treatment in Hollywood, in 1960 Calvet "decided to return to France to make her headquarters."

She continued to act in Italian and French productions as well as making appearances on American television series (Hart to Hart and General Hospital), with occasional roles in films. Her last film was The Sword and the Sorcerer in 1982.

In her memoir, entitled Has Corinne Been a Good Girl? (1983), she stated that the roles she played for Hollywood studios never challenged her acting ability. In 1958, referring to being cast as a French temptress, she told an interviewer, "If I had come to Hollywood as a dramatic actress, I never would have been Corinne Calvet, and you never would have been sitting here talking to me."

Robert Walker and Tom Fadden (right) in Vengeance Valley (1951)

Tom Fadden (January 6, 1895 – April 14, 1980) was an American actor. He performed on the legitimate stage, vaudeville, in films and on television during his long career.

He would make his film debut with a small role in 1939''s I Stole a Million, which stars George Raft and Claire Trevor. He would have his first memorable bit in his next film, Destry Rides Again, starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart, where in the opening scene he is playing cards, and is cheated when Dietrich distracts him by spilling coffee in his lap.

Alex Turner (born 1971 in New York City) is an American film director, producer and screenwriter, best known for his work in the horror film genre, including the cult classic Dead Birds.

He made his first film with a home movie camera given to him by his father, photographer Pete Turner when he was eleven years old. His skewed vision of the world was apparent at an early age in Super 8mm epics like Dr. Griffin''s Creation and Starflight 7.

After graduating from the film program at SUNY Purchase, Turner soon immersed himself in the world of feature and commercial production in New York and Los Angeles. Memorable events from this time include a disastrous stint as a pigeon wrangler on a shoot for commercial director Steve Horn and working as a production assistant on several low budget films including Anthony Hickox''s Warlock: The Armageddon. Turner eventually began directing music videos and made the transition to directing commercials for clients including McDonald''s, General Electric and Quaker State.

Alex''s short film Chuck has screened in over thirty film festivals. It was featured on the Sci-Fi Channel, and won the Rod Serling award at the 2001 Long Island Film Festival. Turner''s second short film, Disposal, starring JK Simmons, can be seen on IFC and was shown as part of LACMA''s 2004 Young Directors Night.

Dead Birds, Turner''s first feature, starring Henry Thomas, Isaiah Washington and Patrick Fugit, premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival.

In 2009 Turner returned to the genre with Red Sands, a psychological thriller starring Shane West, Aldis Hodge, Leonard Roberts, Callum Blue, JK Simmons, Theo Rossi and Noel Gugliemi as US soldiers serving in Afghanistan just after the 2001 US invasion.

Richfield on the ABC series Dinosaurs. For his work on The Jeffersons, Hemsley was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. He also won an NAACP Image Award.

Hemsley was born and raised in South Philadelphia by his mother, who worked in a lamp factory.[1] He did not meet his father until he was 14. He attended Barrat Middle School, Central High School for 9th grade and Bok Technical High School for 10th, when he dropped out of school and joined the United States Air Force, where he served for four years.

On leaving the Air Force, he returned to Philadelphia, where he worked for the United States Postal Service during the day while attending the Academy of Dramatic Arts at night. He then moved to New York, continuing to work for the Post Office during the day while working as an actor at night. He starred as Gitlow in the early 1970s Broadway musical Purlie.

While Hemsley was on Broadway with Purlie, Norman Lear called him in 1971 to play the recurring role of George Jefferson in his new sitcom, All in the Family. Hemsley was reluctant to leave his theatre role, but Lear told him that he would hold the role open for him. Hemsley joined the cast two years later. The characters of Hemsley and co-star Isabel Sanford were supporting occasional roles on All in the Family, but were given their own spin-off, The Jeffersons, two years after Hemsley made his debut on the sitcom. The Jeffersons proved to be one of Lear''s most successful series, enjoying a run of 11 seasons through 1985.

Hemsley was a shy and intensely private man, described by some as reclusive. He avoided the Hollywood limelight and little of his personal life was public knowledge beyond the facts that he never married and he had no children.[9] In 2003, however, Hemsley granted a rare video interview to the Archive of American Television. "It [playing George Jefferson] was hard for me. But he was the character. I had to do it."

On July 24, 2012, Hemsley died at his home in El Paso, Texas, at age 74. The cause of death was given as superior vena cava syndrome, a complication associated with lung and bronchial carcinomas. He had had a malignant mass on one of his lungs for which chemotherapy and radiation had been recommended, according to the El Paso County Texas Medical Examiner''s report.

Marshall Thompson (November 27, 1925 – May 18, 1992) was an American film and television actor. He was born James Marshall Thompson in Peoria, Illinois. In 1943 Thompson, known for his boy-next-door good looks, was signed by Universal Pictures. He played quiet, thoughtful teens in Universal''s feature films, including a lead opposite singing star Gloria Jean in Reckless Age, earning $350 weekly. During 1946 Universal discharged most of its contract players; that same year Thompson moved to MGM and his film roles steadily increased and improved. Thompson became a freelance actor in the 1950s and worked for various studios on a variety of pictures, including a number of horror and science-fiction features; this included the role of Carruthers in It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), one of the two feature films that would later inspire the plot for director Ridley Scott''s 1979 big budget feature film Alien. Thompson also starred as Mel Hunter in the syndicated science fiction TV series World of Giants, about a man who has been miniaturized and must live in a dollhouse. By the 1960s, Thompson''s boyish looks had matured and his screen persona became more authoritative. He co-starred with Annie Fargé in the 33-episode CBS sitcom Angel (1960–1961) about an American architect with a charming but scatterbrained French wife, who often got into zany, Lucy Ricardo-esque situations, caused in part by her lack of English; the show was canceled after 33 episodes due to low ratings, despite critical acclaim for French-born newcomer Annie Fargé. In the mid-1960s Thompson starred in CBS''s Daktari, a television series about a veterinarian in Africa; the series was based on Thompson''s 1965 feature film Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion. Later in his career, he appeared in many television episodes and in feature films such as The Turning Point (1977) and The Formula(1980). Thompson was a brother-in-law of actor Richard Long, best known for his role as Jarrod Barkley in ABC''s The Big Valley. Thompson''s wife, Barbara, was Long''s sister. Marshall Thompson died from congestive heart failure at the age of sixty-six in Royal Oak, Michigan.

His father worked in a rubber factory in Silvertown and he was one of five children who grew up in Addington Road, Canning Town. Varney was educated at the nearby Star Lane Primary School in West Ham and after leaving school at 14, he worked as a messenger boy and a page boy at the Regent Palace Hotel. He took piano lessons as a child and was good enough to find employment as a part-time piano player. His first paid engagement was at Plumstead Radical Club in Woolwich, for which he was paid eight shillings and sixpence (42½p). He also played in working men''s clubs, pubs and ABC cinemas, and later sang with big bands of the time. He and his mother decided that show business was the career for him, and he gave up his day jobs.

During the Second World War, Varney joined the Royal Engineers, but continued his performing career as an army entertainer, touring in the Far East for a time. After being demobilised in the late 1940s, he starred on stage in a comic revue entitled Gaytime, with Benny Hill as his partner in a double act.[2] He then became an all-round entertainer, working his way around the music halls.

Career[edit]

Varney was cast in the role of a foreman in the television sitcom The Rag Trade (1961–63), which made him a household name. He was aware that he was the only performer without West End acting experience and worked hard to make up for it. Slightly later, he starred in a show for BBC TV called The Valiant Varneys (1964–65), performing various characters in front of a live audience. After that followed another comedy role in Beggar My Neighbour (1966–68); this also starred Pat Coombs, June Whitfield, and Peter Jones. Pat Coombs played the wife of Varney''s character. Varney featured in The Great St Trinian''s Train Robbery (1966) with Frankie Howerd, Dora Bryan and George Cole.

Varney''s most successful lead role was in the sitcom On the Buses (1969–73) as the bus driver Stan Butler, who never has much luck where romance is concerned. Varney took considerable lengths to research the role, even taking bus-driving lessons and a test to gain a public service vehicle licence so that he could be filmed driving a bus on the open road. Three spin-off films were made — On the Buses (1971), Mutiny on the Buses (1972) and Holiday on the Buses (1973). Varney was 52 when the first series was recorded, although his character, who lived with his mother and was often trying to attract young women, was supposed to be about 35. Varney was only eleven years younger than Doris Hare, the main actress to play his mother in the series.

His career was interrupted by military service with the Royal Army Ordinance Corps where he was injured in an explosion during a battle training course. Returning to acting, he started making a name for himself in such films as Johnny in the Clouds (1945), When the Bough Breaks (1947), Maniacs on Wheels (1949),  and The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952).  He continued to perform in the theatre limelight and peaked in roles with Katharine Hepburn in "As You Like It" in 1950, and with "The Threepenny Opera" and "The Mikado", which made use of his musical talents. A writer at heart, he penned songs, musicals and plays over the years. Partnered with Mike Sammes, he wrote songs recorded by Pat Boone, Harry Secombe, Engelbert Humperdinck and Sir Cliff Richard, who had a hit with his 1980 song "Marianne".

The son of Bomi and Jer Bulsara, Freddie spent the bulk of his childhood in India where he attended St. Peter’s boarding school. He began taking piano lessons at the age of seven. No one could foresee where a love of music would take him.  The Bulsara family moved to Middlesex in 1964 and from there Freddie joined up with a blues band called Wreckage while studying graphic design courses at Ealing College of Art. While singing for Wreckage, a fellow student introduced Freddie to Roger Taylor and Brian May, founder members of a band called Smile. Smile metamorphosed into Queen when Freddie joined Roger and Brian as the lead vocalist. The final member of the band, which was to stay together for the next 20 years, was bassist John Deacon, who joined the band on 1st of March 1971.  The rest is rock history. EMI Records and Elektra Records signed the band and in 1973 their debut album ‘Queen’ was released and hailed as one of the most exciting developments ever in rock music.  The immortal operatically styled single ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ was released in 1975 and proceeded to the top of the UK charts for 9 weeks. A song that was nearly never released due to its length and unusual style but which Freddie insisted would be played became the instantly recognisable hit. By this time Freddie’s unique talents were becoming clear, a voice with a remarkable range and a stage presence that gave Queen its colourful, unpredictable and flamboyant personality.  Very soon Queen’s popularity extended beyond the shores of the UK as they charted and triumphed around Europe, Japan and the USA where in 1979 they topped the charts with Freddie’s song ‘Crazy Little thing Called Love’.  Queen was always indisputably run as a democratic organisation. All four members are each responsible for having penned number one singles for the band. This massive writing strength combined with spectacular lights, the faultless sound, a sprinkling of theatricality and Freddie’s balletic movements made up Queen on stage and on film.  Through Freddie’s ability to project himself and the band’s music and image to the four corners of 70,000 seater venues they became known as the prime developers of stadium rock, a reputation perpetuated by their pioneering tactics in South America where in 1981 they performed to 231,000 fans in Sao Paulo, a world record at the time. They also became known as the key innovators of pop videos as their catalogue of 3-minute clips became more and more adventurous in style, size and content.  Their phenomenal success continued around the globe throughout the 80’s highlighted in 1985 by their show-stealing and unforgettable performance on stage at Live Aid.

She was born November 22, 1910 in rural Milford, Michigan, and earned a bachelor''s degree from West Michigan University in 1932. A Depression-era school teacher for one year before pursuing her interest in theater, she returned to college (this time Michigan State University) in a fine arts program. She started out on the Chicago stage and in summer stock before migrating to the larger stages in New York and Los Angeles.

Film and TV roles did not come her way until well into middle age. Guesting on such TV shows as "The Andy Griffith Show," "The Twilight Zone," "My Three Sons," "Hazel," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Barnaby Jones" and "Highway to Heaven," she usually appeared as ladylike small-town citizens. She was also part of the ensemble in Peter Bogdanovich''s first low-budget film thriller Targets (1968), which was Boris Karloff''s last feature. In the 70s she started gathering up character bits here and there, such as her nuns in the all-star epic Airport (1970) and the horror Audrey Rose (1977). A variety of pleasant, maternal parts came her way, including Lynn Carlin''s mother in the Blake Edwards'' western Wild Rovers (1971) and Jane Fonda''s in the comedy caper Fun with Dick and Jane (1977). She supported Fonda again in the Vietnam-era drama Coming Home (1978), was among the cast in the cultish Big Top Pee-wee (1988) and had a noticeable role in Steve Martin''s Leap of Faith (1992).

As for "The Waltons" success, character actress Dorothy Stickney played the part of Emily in the initial TV pilot along with Josephine Hutchinson as older sister Mamie. When the series came to fruition, Mary and actress Helen Kleeb, another one of those "I''ve seen her before" character faces, took over the spinster roles. Both she and Kleeb continued their sister act periodically in several Walton "reunion" TV-movies, which included assorted weddings and holiday gatherings. Both ladies made their final TV appearances in A Walton Easter (1997). Kleeb died of natural causes in 2003 at age 96. Mary passed away two years later at age 95 of complications from Parkinson''s disease. - IMDb Mini Biography', 'Milford, Michigan, USA', 1, '/rBi5WNywgvrEnEMegy1rfX25P38.jpg'),

She began singing in public from the age of five in local amateur shows. She then moved to Los Angeles after graduating from high school and then got a job as a singer at the Hollywood Canteen during World War II.

The Canteen, which was a studio-sponsored gathering spot for servicemen, is where Warner Bros. saw her potential and signed her up. She began her film career co-starring in secondary musicals, often paired with either Dennis Morgan or Jack Carson. She later was relegated to rugged adventures and dramas in which she was out of her element. Following her role in the forgettable Two Gals and a Guy released in 1951, she decided to leave the Hollywood scene.

She then took to the Broadway boards and scored a huge hit with the 1951 comedy-mystery play, Remains to Be Seen, co-starring Jackie Cooper. She also toured successfully as a cabaret singer, performing everywhere from New York City and Miami to Las Vegas and Los Angeles.

Stardom came in 1954 with the role of "Babe" in the Broadway musical The Pajama Game. (Doris Day went on to play the role on film.) After a six-year hiatus, Paige returned to films in Silk Stockings (1957), which starred Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, plus the Doris Day comedy Please Don''t Eat the Daisies (1960) followed by a role as a love-starved married neighbor in Bachelor in Paradise with Bob Hope (1961).

John R. "Johnny" Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, actor, and author, who has been called one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Although he is primarily remembered as a country music artist, his songs and sound spanned many other genres including rockabilly and rock and roll—especially early in his career—as well as blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal led to Cash being inducted in both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Late in his career, Cash covered songs by several rock artists, among them the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails and he covered the synthpop band Depeche Mode''s Personal Jesus.

Cash was known for his deep, distinctive bass-baritone voice; for the "boom-chicka-boom" freight train sound of his Tennessee Three backing band; for his rebelliousness, coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor; for providing free concerts inside prison walls; and for his dark performance clothing, which earned him the nickname "The Man in Black". He traditionally started his concerts by saying, "Hello, I''m Johnny Cash." and usually following it up with his standard "Folsom Prison Blues."

Much of Cash''s music, especially that of his later career, echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption. His signature songs include "I Walk the Line", "Folsom Prison Blues", "Ring of Fire", "Get Rhythm" and "Man in Black". He also recorded humorous numbers, including "One Piece at a Time" and "A Boy Named Sue"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called "Jackson"; as well as railroad songs including "Hey, Porter" and "Rock Island Line".

Cash, a devout but troubled Christian, has been characterized as a "lens through which to view American contradictions and challenges." A Biblical scholar, he penned a Christian novel titled Man in White, and he made a spoken word recording of the entire New King James Version of the New Testament. Even so, Cash declared that he was "the biggest sinner of them all", and viewed himself overall as a complicated and contradictory man. Accordingly, Cash is said to have "contained multitudes", and has been deemed "the philosopher-prince of American country music".

Quentin Tarantino referred to him in Entertainment Weekly as one of his favorite directors. His early work is featured in Not Quite Hollywood, an award winning documentary released by Magnolia. Among his early successes were the 20th Century Fox release The Man from Hong Kong, a wry James Bond/Chop Sockey cocktail, the Vietnam battle movie Siege of Firebase Gloria, and the futuristic satire Dead End Drive-In, a particular Tarantino favorite. BMX Bandits, showcasing a 15-year old Nicole Kidman, and Miramax''s The Quest, starring ET''s Henry Thomas, won prizes at children''s film festivals in Montreal and Europe. He has also directed 35 episodes of television series as diverse as Silk Stalkings, Time Trax, The Others, and Flipper. Born in England, where his Australian father was in the RAF, Trenchard-Smith attended UK''s prestigious Wellington College, where he neglected studies in favor of acting and making short films, before migrating to Australia. He started as a news film editor, then graduated to network promos before he became one of a group of young people that, as he recalls, "pushed, shoved, lobbied and bullied the government into introducing investment for Australian made films." He persuaded Australia''s largest distribution-exhibition circuit at the time, the Greater Union Theater Organization, to form an in-house production company that he would run. The company made three successful films in a row, and his career was underway. In parallel careers, he was also founding editor of Australia''s quarterly Movie magazine for 6 years, and has made over 100 trailers for other directors in Australia, Europe, and America. Among his 39 movies, 5 were commissioned by Showtime, including the remake of the World War II classic, Sahara, the highly rated, Happy Face Murders, starring Ann-Margret, and DC 9/11: Time of Crisis, with Timothy Bottoms as President Bush. His frequently repeated family drama for Lifetime, Long Lost Son starring Gabrielle Anwar, introduced future Gossip Girl''s Chace Crawford to audiences in the title role." I knew from his first scene, he was going to be hot." In 2009, Trenchard-Smith shot Porky''s - The College Years, a re-imagining of the famous 80''s franchise of teen comedies. His recent ecological thriller Arctic Blast, starring Michael Shanks, was chosen to premiere at the 2010 Possible Worlds Canadian Film Festival in Sydney.

Her mother, a piano teacher, was attending a play when she went into  labor and made it to the hospital just in time. Judy was an only child.  By the age of four, her mother had her enrolled in ballet school which  fostered a life-long interest in show business. Two years later her  parents divorced. In high school, Judy began to develop an interest in  theater. She appeared in several high school plays. After graduation,  she got a job in the Orson Welles Mercury Theater as a switchboard  operator. Judy worked her way on the stage with appearance in Boston,  Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and New York City. Judy toured on the  nightclub circuit with a group called "The Revuers" founded by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. She went to Hollywood to make her first foray into the film world in Greenwich Village  (1944). Most of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.  Disappointed, but not discouraged, Judy earned two more roles that year  in Something for the Boys (1944) and Winged Victory  (1944). In the latter, Judy had a few lines of dialogue. Judy returned  to New York to continue her stage career. She returned to Hollywood  after five years to appear in Adam''s Rib (1949) as Doris Attinger opposite screen greats Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy and Tom Ewell. With her success in that role, Judy was signed to play Billie Dawn in Born Yesterday  (1950), a role which she originated on Broadway. She was nominated for  and won the best actress Oscar for her performance. After filming The Marrying Kind  (1952), Judy was summoned before the Un-American Activities Committee  to testify about her political affiliations. Fortunately for her, she  was not blacklisted as were many of her counterparts, but damage was  done. Her film career was curtailed somewhat, but rebounded. She  continued with her stage and musical efforts, but with limited time on  the screen. After filming The Solid Gold Cadillac (1956), she was off-screen for four years. Her last film was the MGM production of Bells Are Ringing (1960) with Dean Martin and it was one of her best.

Snub Pollard (9 November 1889 – 19 January 1962) was an Australian-born vaudevillian, who became a silent film comedian in Hollywood, popular in the 1920s.

Born Harold Fraser, in Melbourne, Australia on 9 November 1889, he began performing with Pollard''s Lilliputian Opera Company at a young age. Like many of the actors in the popular juvenile company, he adopted Pollard as his stage name. The company ran several highly successful professional children''s troupes that traveled Australia and New Zealand in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

In 1908, Harry Pollard joined the company tour to North America. After the completion of the tour, he returned to the US. By 1915 he was regularly appearing in uncredited roles in movies, for example Charles Epting notes that Pollard can clearly be seen in Chaplin''s 1915 short By the Sea. In later years, Pollard claimed Hal Roach had discovered him while he was performing on stage in Los Angeles.

Pollard played supporting roles in the early films of Harold Lloyd and Bebe Daniels. The long-faced Pollard sported a Kaiser Wilhelm mustache turned upside-down; this became his trademark. Lloyd''s producer, Hal Roach, gave Pollard his own starring series of one- and two-reel shorts. The most famous is 1923''s It''s a Gift, in which he plays an inventor of many Rube Goldberg-like contraptions, including a car that runs by magnet power.

In early 1923, shortly after his second marriage, Pollard returned with his wife Elizabeth to see his relations in Australia. His visit attracted considerable attention, and he appeared again in several theatres to speak about the motion picture business. On his return to the US, he left Roach and joined the low-budget Weiss Brothers studio in 1926. There he co-starred with Marvin Loback as a poor man''s version of Laurel and Hardy, copying that team''s plots and gags.

In later years, Pollard claimed the Great Depression wiped out his investments, and he had been unable to "adjust to the talkies." However, in the 1930s, he played small parts in talking comedies, and was featured as comic relief in "B" westerns. Pollard''s silent-comedy credentials guaranteed him work in slapstick revivals. He appeared with other film veterans in Hollywood Cavalcade (1939), The Perils of Pauline (1947), and Man of a Thousand Faces (1957). He also appeared regularly as a supporting player in Columbia Pictures'' two-reel comedies of the mid-1940s.

Forsaking his familiar mustache in his later years, he landed much steadier work in films as a mostly uncredited bit player. He played incidental roles in scores of Hollywood features and shorts, almost always as a mousy, nondescript fellow, usually with no dialogue.

Snub Pollard died of cancer on 19 January 1962, aged 72, after nearly 50 years in the movie business. His interment was at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

Ben Bard (January 26, 1893, Milwaukee – May 17, 1974, Los Angeles) was a movie actor, stage actor, and acting teacher. With comedian Jack Pearl, Bard worked in a comedy duo in vaudeville. In 1926, Bard, Pearl, and Sascha Beaumont appeared in a short film made in Lee DeForest''s Phonofilm sound-on-film process.

Bard had a small roll in Roland West''s classic mystery The Bat Whispers (1930). Later in the decade, he ran a leading Hollywood acting school, Ben Bard Drama. He married the serial film star Ruth Roland in 1929, and was married to Roland until her death in 1937.

Bard was recruited to be a leading man at Fox Film Corporation. However, he was typecast as a "Suave Heavy"—a smooth-talking, well-dressed fellow with a dark side. An example of this type is his portrayal of "Mr. Brun" in The Seventh Victim (1943).

Also in 1943, Bard appeared in two other Val Lewton-produced horror films: The Leopard Man, as Robles, the Police Chief, and The Ghost Ship, as First Officer Bowns.

In 1939, he married Roma Clarisse, an actress and last recipient of the Ruth Roland Scholarship to Ben Bard Drama. They had 3 children before she died in 1947.

In 1948 Bard married Jackie Lynn Taylor, an actress in the Our Gang series. They divorced in 1954. During the 1950s, Bard was the head of the New Talent Department at Twentieth Century Fox. He re-opened his school, Ben Bard Drama, in 1960.

Bard died in Los Angeles in 1974. His resting place is with Ruth Roland at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale. He is survived by his son Bryan Barak Bard, who is a video documentary artist living in Israel. He is also survived by his other son Bartley Bard, who is a professional director and screenwriter.

Marion Martin (born Marion Suplee, June 7, 1909 – August 13, 1985) was an American movie and stage actress.

Martin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of a Bethlehem Steel executive. She became an actress after her family fortune was lost in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and appeared in the Broadway productions Lombardi Ltd. and Sweet Adeline.

She made her film debut in She''s My Lillie, I''m Her Willie and subsequently played minor roles, often as showgirls. Several of her early roles were in musicals and she achieved some success as a singer. By the end of the decade she had played leading female roles in several "B" pictures, playing one of her most notable roles in James Whale''s Sinners in Paradise (1938). Despite her success she was often cast in minor roles in more widely seen films such as His Girl Friday (1940). The majority of her roles were in comedies but she also appeared in dramas such as Boom Town (1940) in which she played a dance hall singer who is briefly romanced by Clark Gable. She played secondary roles in three Lupe Vélez "Mexican Spitfire" films in the early 1940s, and was a comic foil for the Marx Brothers in The Big Store, where the back of her skirt is cut away by Harpo.

She played a ghost in Gildersleeve''s Ghost, and was the subject of a legendary fistfight between Gildersleeve star Harold Peary and Warner Bros studio mogul Bud Stevens at the Mocambo nightclub in 1943. Her more substantial roles included Alice Angel, a dizzy showgirl, in the murder mystery Lady of Burlesque with Barbara Stanwyck and Angel on My Shoulder. She also appeared in The Big Street with Lucille Ball, in the western The Woman of the Town with Claire Trevor and in The Great Mike at PRC in 1944.

By the late 1940s, her roles were often minor. Three Stooges fans will remember her as western cowgirl Gladys in Merry Mavericks. She played "Belle Farnol" in a 1950 episode of The Lone Ranger entitled "Pardon for Curley". Shortly afterward, she made her final film appearance in 1952. Married to a physicist, Martin retired, and although she expressed the desire to return to show business, suitable roles were not offered to her.

She was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to motion pictures, at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard. She died in 1985 in Santa Monica, California, and was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.', 'Philadelphia, PA', 1, '/ci5vfUjqZxm8y27tr1pMKHto7fi.jpg'),
        (85901, 'Connie Marshall', '1933-04-28', 'A promising blue-to-gray-eyed, blonde-haired child actress of the  post-WWII years who had more talent than she was given credit for,  little Connie Marshall was born on April 28, 1938 (some sources list  1933) in New York City. Her parents were not of show business stock, her  father being a lieutenant with the Allied Military Government in  Europe. She was a direct descent of this country''s first Chief Justice,  John Marshall, and was also a descendant of Geradus Beekamn, who was the  first colonial governor of New York.

A strikingly  sensitive-looking tyke with sad, beady eyes, she broke into the  competitive side of show business quite young (age 5) as a pig-tailed  model for commercial newspapers and magazines. Frequently used by New  York photographers, artists and caricaturists, she began her acting  career a year later quite by happenstance. A failed screen test taken in  Hollywood was, by luck, seen by 20th Century-Fox director Lloyd Bacon who just happened to be casting the role of little Mary Osborne in the warm family comedy-drama Sunday Dinner for a Soldier (1944). The film went on to star the future husband and wife team of Anne Baxter and John Hodiak, who first met and fell in love while shooting this picture. Director Bacon stopped looking when he came across Connie.

Educated  at the Gardner School in New York, where she appeared in a few plays,  and the Fox Studio School, Connie also studied ballet and ballroom  dancing. She made a strong impression in her very first film, with a  natural forlorn ease as one of the Osborne children that also included  up-and-coming Bobby Driscoll. With Connie''s second picture Sentimental Journey (1946), she was handed her best weepy-eyed showcase. Fatally ill actress Maureen O''Hara adopts an orphan girl (Connie) so her Broadway producer husband John Payne  will have someone to care for after she passes away. The treacly plot  follows the difficult adjustment between the grief-stricken two who are  left behind, but eventually guided together by O''Hara''s spirit. The  pathetic storyline was a bit much but Connie held her own beautifully  and received rave reviews.

Connie continued to show precocious promise in the post-war years in both sentimental drama and lightweight comedy with Dragonwyck (1946) as the daughter of Vincent Price; Home, Sweet Homicide (1946) as an amateur young sleuth who tries to solve a neighborhood murder aided by brother and sister Peggy Ann Garner and Dean Stockwell; Mother Wore Tights (1947) as the daughter of song-and-dance team Betty Grable and Dan Dailey; and the noted comedy classic Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948) as one of the Blandings offspring of Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. These subsequent film roles, however, didn''t match in importance when compared to her first two films.

Connie was to work with the silver screen''s top movie stars over the years, including Gene Tierney and Joan Crawford, but once she outgrew her precociousness, her career began to fade away. She attempted TV with the short-lived series "Doc Corkle" (1952) and appeared as a feisty teen co-star opposite Gene Autry in his film oater Saginaw Trail (1953), but by 1954, after an un-billed part in Rogue Cop (1954), Connie was literally and figuratively out of the picture.', 'New York, New York City, USA', 1, '/yk6N3kFxWfT7phOxdkHvhVMh72q.jpg'),

His first appearance in a film was A Yank at Oxford (1938), but war service interrupted his career as an actor. He served as a second lieutenant in the Small Arms Section of Special Operations Executive at Station VI during World War II (James Bond author, Ian Fleming worked in the same section). He is best known for his appearances, wearing his thick-rimmed round spectacles, in British comedies of the 1950s and 1960s, often as a "Man from the Ministry" or similar character. He was also involved as the secretary to Lord Scrumptious in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

Such appearances included the St Trinian''s films (The Belles of St Trinian''s, Blue Murder at St Trinian''s, and The Great St Trinian''s Train Robbery) as Manton Bassett, a civil servant who was the Deputy Director of Schools in the Ministry of Education, where he was often seen frowning and expressing indignation at the outrageous behaviour of other characters. To American audiences, Wattis is probably best known for his performance as the British civil servant Northbrook in The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). He broke from this typecasting in his later films, such as his starring role in Games That Lovers Play.

Wattis''s other films included Hobson''s Choice, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Carry On Spying, The Colditz Story, Dentist on the Job, Very Important Person, The Happiest Days of Your Life, and The Longest Day.

She may be best remembered for appearing as Aunt Milly Forrest in thirteen entries in MGM''s Andy Hardy film series.

Haden first appeared on the stage in the early 1920s. As early as October 1920, she was appearing with Walter Hampden''s acting troupe. Her Broadway debut came in Trigger (1927).

She made her film debut in 1934 (one year after her mother''s retirement) in the Katharine Hepburn vehicle Spitfire. Haden later became a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player in the late 1930s and had smallish roles in many of the studio''s films, most notably in the Andy Hardy series starring Mickey Rooney, cast as the spinsterish Aunt Milly Forrest.

Haden made her last film, Andy Hardy Comes Home, in 1958, but was active on television until a 1965 guest spot on Dr. Kildare. She was most notable for her stern, humorless characterisations such as a truant officer in Shirley Temple''s Captain January (1936), but she also played the much-loved teacher Miss Pipps, who is unjustly fired in the Our Gang comedy Come Back, Miss Pipps (1941). Other films in which she appeared include Poor Little Rich Girl (1936), The Shop Around the Corner (1940), Woman of the Year (1942), and The Bishop''s Wife (1947).

Joseph H. Lewis  (April 6, 1907–August 30, 2000), was an American B-movie film director.

Although he worked with both Béla Lugosi (The Invisible Ghost) and Lionel Atwill in early 1940s horror, he is best known for his work in film noir from the late 40s and the 1950s. His most acclaimed feature, Gun Crazy (1949), is a dark romance about gun-obsession, and notable for its use of location photography.

At the dawn of his career (1937–1940), when Lewis was directing inexpensive westerns, he earned the derogatory nickname "Wagon-Wheel Joe" from the studio editors, because of his tendency to use wagon-wheels for constructing interesting visual compositions within the frame.

Lewis''s offbeat and eye-catching compositions added style and value to inexpensive productions. His 1944 musical Minstrel Man, starring singer Benny Fields, is quite possibly the finest film ever made by low-budget PRC Pictures. Industry insiders noticed, prompting Columbia Pictures to hire Lewis to film the musical sequences for its blockbuster musical The Jolson Story.

Toward the end of Lewis''s career, he worked in television, directing mostly westerns: The Rifleman, Bonanza, The Big Valley, Gunsmoke, and the pilot for Branded.

He had a brother, Edward Sheffield Cassan, and a sister, Flora Kathleen Sheffield Cassan, who became an actress known as Flora Sheffield.

His father was born in Ireland and his mother in England. They were married in London in 1892. Matthew died when Reginald was nine. In 1913 Reginald (billed as Eric Desmond) appeared in David Copperfield. In 1914, Alice Sheffield and her children emigrated to the United States, where they lived in Queens, New York. Reginald acted on the stage and in films. While his sister Flora was an actress, brother Edward worked as an accountant in a bank and later became a theatrical agent.

Sheffield''s Broadway performances credited as Reggie Sheffield include Evidence (1914), in which his mother also appeared, The Merry Wives of Windsor (1916), If (1917), The Betrothal (1918), and Helena''s Boys (1924). His performances credited as Reginald Sheffield include Youth (1920), The Way Things Happen (1924), Hay Fever (1925), Slaves All (1926), Soldiers and Women (1929), and Dear Old England (1930).

Reginald Sheffield was married in 1927 to Louise Van Loon (21 January 1905 – 14 April 1987), a New York-born Vassar College graduate with a liberal arts education. The couple had three children:  Mary Alice Sheffield Cassan (born 1928), Jon Matthew Sheffield Cassan (11 April 1931 – 15 October 2010) (aka actor Johnny Sheffield), and William Hart Sheffield Cassan (15 July 1935 – 12 December 2010) (actor Billy Sheffield).

As film production became more and more located in Southern California, Sheffield and his wife travelled back and forth between New York City and Los Angeles. After several years they moved permanently to the West Coast.

Being a trained stage actor, Sheffield easily made the transition from silent films to talkies. He was a working actor who became memorable in numerous character and supporting roles and appeared with some of the greatest film stars of the day, including Constance Bennett, William Powell, George Arliss, Loretta Young, Gary Cooper, Errol Flynn, Rosalind Russell, Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine.

Hugh Milburn Stone (July 5, 1904 – June 12, 1980) was an American actor, best known for his role as "Doc" (Dr. Galen Adams) on the CBS Western series Gunsmoke.

Stone was born in Burrton, Kansas, to Herbert Stone and the former Laura Belfield. There, he graduated from Burrton High School, where he was active in the drama club, played basketball, and sang in a barbershop quartet.

His brother, Joe, was a writer who was the author of scripts for three episodes of Gunsmoke.

In 1919, Stone debuted on stage in a Kansas tent show. He ventured into vaudeville in the late 1920s, and in 1930, he was half of the Stone and Strain song-and-dance act. His Broadway credits include Around the Corner (1936) and Jayhawker (1934).

In the 1930s, Stone came to Los Angeles, California, to launch his own screen career. He was featured in the "Tailspin Tommy" adventure serial for Monogram Pictures. In 1940, he appeared with Marjorie Reynolds, Tristram Coffin, and I. Stanford Jolley in the comedy espionage film Chasing Trouble. That same year, he co-starred with Roy Rogers in the film Colorado in the role of Rogers'' brother-gone-wrong.

Stone appeared uncredited in the 1939 film Blackwell''s Island. Stone played Dr. Blake in the 1943 film Gung Ho! and a liberal-minded warden in Monogram Pictures'' Prison Mutiny in 1943. Signed by Universal Pictures in 1943, in the film Captive Wild Woman (1943), Jungle Woman (1943), Sherlock Holmes Faces Death [Captain Pat Vickery], (1944), he became a familiar face in its features and serials.

In 1955, one of CBS Radio''s hit series, the Western Gunsmoke, was adapted for television and recast with experienced screen actors. Howard McNear, the radio Doc Adams, was replaced by Stone, who gave the role a harder edge consistent with his screen portrayals. He stayed with Gunsmoke through its entire television run, with the exception of 7 episodes in 1971, when Stone required heart surgery and Pat Hingle replaced him as Dr. Chapman. Stone appeared in 604 episodes through 1975, often shown sparring in a friendly manner with co-stars Dennis Weaver and Ken Curtis, who played, respectively, Chester Goode and Festus Haggen.

In June 1980, Stone died of a heart attack in La Jolla. He was survived by his second wife, the former Jane Garrison, a native of Hutchinson, Kansas, who died in 2002. Stone had a surviving daughter, Shirley Stone Gleason (born circa 1926) of Costa Mesa, California, from his first marriage of 12 years to Ellen Morrison, formerly of Delphos, Kansas, who died in 1937. He was buried at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego.

In 1968, Stone received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Drama for his work on Gunsmoke.

For his contribution to the television industry, Milburn Stone has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1981, Stone was inducted posthumously into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.

Rohit Shetty is a film director, presenter and cinematographer. He is the son of the late actor and fight master M. B. Shetty, who acted in many Hindi and Kannada movies. He is married and has two children. He started his career at the age of 15 as an assistant director with Kuku Kohli on the film Phool Aur Kaante starring Ajay Devgn; he directed his first feature film, Zameen, as an independent director with Devgan in 2003 at the age of 29.

He is from India, from the city of Mangalore in Karnataka. He was interested in films since childhood as he belonged to a film family. At 13 or 14, he was certain that he wanted to be a director and never thought of becoming an actor.

Then he started working, first as an apprentice with Kuku Kohli during Phool Aur Kaante (Ajay Devgan''s debut film that costarred Madhoo). Then he assisted him in Ek Aur Kohinoor, which was never released. He also worked with him on Suhaag (Ajay, Akshay Kumar, Karisma Kapoor), Haqeeqat (1995) (Ajay, Tabu) and Zulmi (Akshay, Twinkle Khanna).

By then, he had developed a good rapport with Ajay Devgn. After that he started working with Anees Bazmee on Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha (Ajay, Kajol), followed by Ajay''s home productions, Hindustan Ki Kasam and Raju Chacha.

During the making of Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha, he knew he was ready to make his own film. When they were planning Raju Chacha, it was decided that he would make his directorial debut after Ajay Devgan, and Ajay would act in it.

Shetty is also the judge of a comedy show known as Comedy Circus.

She was signed by an independent film production company that had gone under by the time she got to Hollywood. She spent several years at Universal as a leading lady in "B" pictures, including several Johnny Mack Brown westerns, but her option was dropped in late 1941. By this time she had married writer (later director) Richard Brooks and, with a certain Broadway hoofer having just signed at MGM, dropped the Kelly and became Jean Brooks. She signed with RKO, where film buffs know her for her three appearances for cult producer Val Lewton, particularly her stunning performance as a haunted devil worshiper in The Seventh Victim (1943).

Her clipped delivery and intense, forceful acting style made her a promising bet for stardom, but RKO lost interest in her by mid-''44 and her roles got gradually smaller until she was dropped in 1946. She and Brooks divorced (his later studio biographies omitted her name as one of his ex-wives). For many years she was listed as a "Lost Player" championed in several magazine articles by writer Doug McClelland. She was eventually located in San Francisco, where she had moved after her film career petered out, and was employed as a classified ad solicitor on the "San Francisco Examiner" newspaper. She had married a printer called Leddy. Her death at the Kaiser Hospital in Richmond, California, in 1963 was due to nutritional problems caused by alcoholism, a sad ending for a stylish and talented performer who didn''t get the breaks she deserved, both personally and professionally.

Born and raised in Toronto, Canada, Stewart began photographing underwater when he was 13. By the age of 18 he became a scuba instructor and then moved on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology, studying in Ontario, Jamaica and Kenya. Before making Sharkwater (2007), Stewart spent four years travelling the world as chief photographer for the Canadian Wildlife Federation''s magazines. Leading expeditions to the most remote areas of the world, Stewart has logged thousands of hours underwater using the latest in camera and rebreather technologies. Stewart''s highly sought after images have appeared in nearly every media form worldwide. While on assignment to photograph sharks in the Galapagos Islands, Stewart discovered illegal longlining, indiscriminately killing sharks within the marine reserve. He tried promoting awareness through print media, but when the public didn''t respond, Stewart decided to make a film to bring people closer to sharks. At the age of 22 he left his photography career behind and embarked on a remarkable journey over four years and 12 countries, resulting in the epic Sharkwater. When Stewart boarded Sea Shepherd''s ship, Sharkwater took a turn from a beautiful underwater film into an incredible human drama filled with corruption, espionage, attempted murder charges and mafia rings, forcing Stewart and his crew to become part of the story. During filming, Stewart encountered life threatening obstacles, including diseases such as West Nile, Tuberculosis, Dengue Fever and flesh eating disease. Sharkwater has been hugely successful, premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival and winning a "Canada''s Top Ten" award. Sharkwater made history with the largest opening weekend of any Canadian documentary, and was the most award-winning documentary of the year, winning over 35 awards at prestigious film festivals around the world. As of 2012 it is the third highest grossing Canadian documentary in the last ten years, next to the high budget films, Nascar and Oceans. Stewart''s hardcover book, Sharkwater: An Odyssey to Save the Planet, was released in October 2007 by Key Porter Books. His book Save the Humans will be released in the Fall of 2012 by Random House. Stewart continues to work towards conservation and environmental education, speaking at the University of Victoria, Yale University, Vancouver Aquarium, ROM, various TEDx events, and others. Stewart is on the board of numerous conservation groups including WildAid, Shark Savers and the Shark Research Institute, and recently founded his own charity, United Conservationists, based in Los Angeles and Toronto. He has made featured appearances on numerous high profile TV shows including Larry King Live, The Today Show, Tonight Show, The Late Show, Nightline, Access Hollywood, Entertainment Tonight, ET Canada, Bloomberg, The Hour, BBC1, MTV and others. In a 2011 The Grid Magazine survey, he was voted top living resident for making Toronto a better place.

Born John Hoeffer in Richmond, Indiana, Foster originally became a cub reporter on a local newspaper in Indiana before going to New York in the hopes of getting a better newspaper job but there were no vacancies. He tried a number of theatrical agencies before getting stage work and later appeared on Broadway in the George S. Kaufman / Ring Lardner play June Moon in 1929. He has also acted in London, England.

He started working in crowd scenes in films before moving to bigger parts. His film acting credits include Prosperity (1932), Pilgrimage (1933), Rafter Romance (1933) with Ginger Rogers and State Fair (1933). He has written several plays. He gave up acting in the late 1930s to pursue directing, although he occasionally appeared in movies and television programs.

Some of Foster''s directorial efforts include The Sign of Zorro (1958), and the stylish films noir Kiss the Blood Off My Hands (1948), Woman on the Run (1950) and Journey into Fear (1943). Foster directed Rachel and the Stranger and the Davy Crockett segments of Disneyland that were edited into feature films Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier and Davy Crockett and the River Pirates where he did not accept any interference from Walt Disney.

In 1967, he directed Brighty of the Grand Canyon, based on a children''s novel by Marguerite Henry about a burro in the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. The film starred Joseph Cotten, Karl Swenson, Dick Foran, and Pat Conway.

It was rumored that Orson Welles took over direction of Journey Into Fear, which Welles later denied. Foster was the director of the "My Friend Bonito" segment of Orson Welles'' Pan-American anthology film It''s All True until RKO aborted the project.

Foster directed a number of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto mysteries, including Charlie Chan in Panama (1940), Charlie Chan at Treasure Island (1939), Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation (1939), Charlie Chan in Reno (1939), Mr. Moto''s Last Warning (1939), Mysterious Mr. Moto (1938), Mr. Moto Takes a Chance (1938), Thank You, Mr. Moto (1937), and Think Fast, Mr. Moto (1937).

Foster was married to Claudette Colbert from 1928 until their divorce in 1935. In 1937, he wed actress Sally Blane, an older sister of Loretta Young. The couple remained married until his death in 1976 from cancer in Santa Monica at the age of 75. They had two children, Robert and Gretchen.

He is buried in Culver City''s Holy Cross Cemetery.

Senkichi Taniguchi (February 19, 1912 – October 29, 2007) was a Japanese film director and screenwriter.

Born in Tokyo, Japan, he attended Waseda University but left before graduating due to his involvement in a left-wing theater troupe. He joined P.C.L. (a precursor to Toho) in 1933 and began working as an assistant director to Kajirō Yamaguchi alongside his longtime friend, acclaimed Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa. He made his feature film directing debut in 1947 with Snow Trail, which was written by Kurosawa. Snow Trial starred Toshirō Mifune in his film debut and actress Setsuko Wakayama. It helped establish Taniguchi''s reputation for action film.

Taniguchi and Wakayama married in 1949 (he had earlier been married to the screenwriter Yōko Mizuki), but the couple divorced in 1956. Taniguchi married his second wife, actress Kaoru Yachigusa, in 1957. Yachigusa and Taniguchi remained together for over fifty years until his death in 2007.

Taniguchi was the screenwriter for the 1949 film, The Quiet Duel, which Kurosawa directed and which also starred Mifune. His most acclaimed film as a director was Escape at Dawn, a controversial anti-war work from 1950 about a Japanese soldier and a "comfort woman" that got into trouble with Occupation era censors. Taniguchi continued to direct movies throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but the quality of his work declined. His films from the time period include Man Against Man, The Gambling Samurai, Man In The Storm and The Lost World of Sinbad. His 1965 film International Secret Police: Key of Keys has been famously re-dubbed and re-released as What''s Up, Tiger Lily? by Woody Allen. He was chosen as the supervising director of the official documentary of Expo ''70.

Senkichi Taniguchi died of pneumonia at a hospital in Tokyo, Japan, on October 29, 2007, at the age of 95.

She returned in the mid-30s, as a  teenager this time, and began the typical assembly-line route of extra  and bit roles for various mega studios, this time billed as Marjorie  Moore. Her first speaking role was in Columbia Studio''s programmer Murder in Greenwich Village  (1937), this time billed as Marjorie Reynolds (her first husband''s last  name), a moniker she kept for the duration of her career. The blonde  (originally brunette) actress then went through a rather unchallenging  prairie flower phase opposite Hollywood''s top western stars such as Tex Ritter, Buck Jones, Roy Rogers and Tim Holt. It all paid off, however, when she won the top female role opposite Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire in the seasonal film classic Holiday Inn (1942), a role originally designed for Mary Martin.  It remains Marjorie''s most popular and cherished role on film, but it  did not help her make a permanent transition into ''A'' quality fare. She  continued as a dependable "B" co-lead in such films as Up in Mabel''s Room (1944), Meet Me on Broadway (1946), and Heaven Only Knows (1947), with an exciting movie offer such as Fritz Lang''s Ministry of Fear  (1944) coming her way on a rare occasion. Along with maturity and a new  entertainment medium (television) in the 50s came a return to her  natural hair color. As William Bendix''s patient, resourceful brunette wife on the comedy TV series The Life of Riley  (1953), Marjorie became a semi-household name. Her career took a steep  decline following its demise five years later and she was only  sporadically seen in films, commercials and TV guest spots after that.  Married twice, her first husband was Jack Reynolds, who was an Assistant Casting Director for Samuel Goldwyn. They had one daughter, Linda, before divorcing in 1952 after 16 years.

Bromfield was born in South Bend, Indiana. He played football and was a boxing champion in college. He served in the United States Navy. In 1948, he twice harpooned a whale in the documentary film Harpoon. In 1948, he was cast as a detective in the film Sorry, Wrong Number, starring Burt Lancaster and Barbara Stanwyck for Columbia Pictures. In 1953, Bromfield appeared with Esther Williams in the film Easy to Love set in bathing suit attire in Cypress Gardens, Florida. In the middle 1950s, he appeared in westerns, such as NBC''s Frontier anthology series in the role of a sheriff in the episode "The Hanging at Thunder Butte Creek". He also starred in horror films, including the 1955 3D production, Revenge of the Creature, one of the Creature from the Black Lagoon sequels.

In 1956, Bromfield was cast as law enforcement officer Frank Morgan in the syndicated western-themed crime drama series, Sheriff of Cochise, later retitled by studio boss Desi Arnaz, Sr., as U.S. Marshal. The real sheriff of Cochise County at the time, Jack Howard, visited the set when the program began and made Bromfield an honorary deputy. Bromfield once told the Los Angeles Times: "About 40 million see ''Sheriff of Cochise'' or ''U.S. Marshal'' every week. I''d have to do about twenty-five pictures, major pictures, over a span of eight or nine years for enough people to see me in the theater who see me in one week on ''U.S. Marshal''. ... The show is seen all over the world. Television is a fabulous medium." The series was actually created by his co-star Stan Jones (1914–1963), who appeared in twenty-four segments as Deputy Harry Olson. Sheriff of Cochise featured numerous young actors who later became well-known in the industry: Mike Connors, Gavin MacLeod, David Janssen, Michael Landon, Stacy Keach, Charles Bronson, Jack Lord, Doug McClure, Ross Martin, and Martin Milner.

In 1960, Bromfield retired from acting to produce sports shows and work as a commercial fisherman off Newport Beach, California. Bromfield was divorced from actresses Corinne Calvet (1925–2001) and Larri Thomas (born 1933). He died at the age of eighty-three of renal failure in Palm Desert, California, having been survived by his third wife of forty-three years, Mary Bromfield.

The album''s lead single of the same name (originally intended to be recorded by Patsy Cline in the early 1960s) became a Top 10 hit. With immediate success, Rimes attained widespread national acclaim for her similarities to Cline''s vocal style. When Rimes released her sophomore studio effort in 1997, You Light up My Life: Inspirational Songs, Rimes went more towards country pop material, which would set the trend for a string of albums that would be released into the next decade.

Since her debut, Rimes has won many major industry awards, which include two Grammys, three ACMs, one CMA, twelve Billboard Music Awards, and one American Music award. In addition, Rimes has also released ten studio albums and four compilation albums through her record label of 13 years, Asylum-Curb, and placed over 40 singles on American and international charts since 1996. She has sold over 37 million records worldwide, with 20.3 million album sales in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Clarence Muse (October 14, 1889 – October 13, 1979) was an actor, screenwriter, director, composer, and lawyer. He was inducted in the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in 1973. Muse was the first Negro to "star" in a film. He acted for more than sixty years appearing in more than 150 movies.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Alexander and Mary Muse, he studied at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and received an international law degree in 1911. He was acting in New York by the 1920s, during the Harlem Renaissance with two Harlem theatres, Lincoln Players and Lafayette Players.

Muse moved to Chicago for a while, and then moved to Hollywood and performed in Hearts in Dixie (1929), the first all-black movie. For the next fifty years, he worked regularly in minor and major roles. While with the Lafayette Players, Muse worked under the management of producer Robert Levy on productions that helped black actors to gain prominence and respect. In regards to the Lafayette Theatre''s staging of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Muse said the play was relevant to black actors and audiences "because, in a way, it was every black man''s story. Black men too have been split creatures inhabiting one body.". Muse appeared as an opera singer, minstrel show performer, vaudeville and Broadway actor; he also wrote songs, plays, and sketches. In 1943, he became the first African American Broadway director with Run Little Chillun.

Muse was also the co-writer of several notable songs. In 1931, with Leon René and Otis René, Muse wrote "When It''s Sleepy Time Down South", also known as "Sleepy Time Down South". The song was sung by Nina Mae McKinney in the movie Safe in Hell (1931), and later became a signature song of Louis Armstrong.

He was the major star in Broken Earth (1936), which related the story of a black sharecropper whose son miraculously recovers from fever through the father''s fervent prayer. Shot on a farm in the South with nonprofessional actors (except for Muse), the film''s early scenes focused in a highly realistic manner on the incredible hardship of black farmers, with plowing scenes. In 1938, Muse co-starred with boxer Joe Louis in Spirit of Youth, the fictional story of a champion boxer which featured an all black cast. Muse and Langston Hughes wrote the script for Way Down South (1939).

Muse performed in Broken Strings (1940), as a concert violinist who opposes the desire of his son to play "swing". From 1955-56, Muse was a regular on the weekly TV version of Casablanca, playing Sam the pianist (a part he was under consideration for in the original Warner Brothers film), and in 1959, he played Peter, the Honey Man, in Porgy and Bess.

He appeared on Disney''s TV miniseries The Swamp Fox. Other film credits include Buck and the Preacher (1972), The World''s Greatest Athlete (1973) and as Gazenga''s Assistant, "Snapper" in Car Wash (1976).

He has primarily appeared in Shaw Brothers productions, and was one of the first solid trained, martial arts stars employed by the company. His first appearance in a Shaw work was in the 1969 film The Chinese Boxer, alongside Jimmy Wang Yu and Ben McDonald.

Chen branched out as an actor with his tender roles in The Tea House and its sequel Big Brother Cheng, both directed by Chih-hung Kwei. These films gave Chen status as a "legitimate actor". After starring in the box office successes Challenge of the Masters and Executioners from Shaolin, both helmed by the legendary martial arts director Lau Kar-leung, Chen left the Shaw Brothers Studio.

While away from Shaw, Chen directed and starred in the 1977 film Iron Monkey (not to be confused with the 1993 film by Yuen Woo-Ping). Chen later returned to the Shaw Brothers in the films Crippled Avengers (directed by Chang Cheh), Killer Constable (directed by Chih-hung Kwei), and 3 Evil Masters (co-starring Yuen Tak of the Seven Little Fortunes).

To date Chen has starred in over 100 films, around 80 of which were with Shaw Brothers. His latest appearances were in Wilson Yip''s 2006 martial arts-fantasy Dragon Tiger Gate, and in the 2007 remake of the King Hu classic, The Valiant Ones New.

He takes a deep puff and joyously exhales.

Ben Lyon (February 6, 1901 – March 22, 1979) was an American actor and a studio executive at 20th Century Fox.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Lyon entered films in 1918 after a successful appearance on Broadway opposite Jeanne Eagels. He attracted attention in the highly successful film Flaming Youth (1923), and steadily developed into a leading man. He was most successfully paired with some of the leading actresses of the silent era including Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, Colleen Moore, Barbara La Marr, Viola Dana, Anna Q. Nilsson, Mary Astor and Blanche Sweet.

He had success as an actor in the 1930 film Hell''s Angels. The film was a major success and brought Jean Harlow to prominence, but Lyon''s performance as an heroic World War I aviator was also highly regarded. For the next decade he was constantly in demand, but his popularity began to wane by the early 1940s. By the mid-1940s he was working for 20th Century Fox. On July 17, 1946 he met a young aspiring actress named Norma Jeane Dougherty.[2] After his first meeting with her he stated that she was "Jean Harlow all over again!". He organized a color screen test for the actress, renamed her, and finally signed her as Marilyn Monroe to her first studio contract.

During World War II, Lyons and his wife, actress Bebe Daniels, settled in London. The couple, along with the comedian Vic Oliver, starred in the radio series Hi, Gang!, which ran from 1940 to 1949. Hi Gang was succeeded in 1950 by Life with the Lyons, which also featured their real life son Richard and daughter Barbara, and had a run on BBC and independent television from 1954 until 1960.

Lyon married actress Bebe Daniels in June 1930. They had two children: daughter Barbara in 1932 and a son Richard whom they adopted. Daniels suffered a severe stroke in 1963 and withdrew from public life. She suffered a second stroke in late 1970. She died at the couple''s London home in March 1971.

In 1974, Lyon married the actress Marian Nixon whom he had known since the 1920s.

On March 22, 1979, Lyon and his second wife Marian Nixon were vacationing together on the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship near Honolulu, Hawaii, when Lyon suffered a fatal heart attack. He is interred in the Chapel Columbarium at Hollywood Forever Cemetery next to his first wife, Bebe.

Bob Steele (January 23, 1907 - December 21, 1988) was an American actor. He was born Robert Adrian Bradbury in Portland, Oregon, into a vaudeville family. After years of touring, the family settled down in Hollywood in the late 1910s, where his father, Robert N. Bradbury, soon found work in the movies, first as an actor, later as a director, and by 1920, he hired Bob and his twin brother Bill (1907–1971) as juvenile leads for a series of adventure movies entitled "The Adventures of Bob and Bill".

Bob''s career began to take off for good in 1927, when he was hired by production company Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Westerns. Bob—who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO—soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their "Billy the Kid" series), plus he had the occasional role in an A-movie, as in the adaptation of John Steinbeck''s novel, Of Mice and Men from 1939.

In the 1940s, Bob''s career as a cowboy hero was on the decline, but he kept himself working by accepting supporting roles in many big movies like Howard Hawks'' The Big Sleep, or the John Wayne vehicles Island in the Sky, Rio Bravo and Rio Lobo. Besides these he also made occasional appearances in science fiction films like Atomic Submarine and Giant from the Unknown and did lots of television work, culminating in a regular supporting role in the army comedy F Troop (1965–1967), which allowed him to show his comic talent. Steele played the character of Trooper Duffy who claimed to have been "shoulder to shoulder with Davy Crockett at the Alamo"-in fact Steele played in With Davy Crockett at the Fall of the Alamo in 1926.

Bob Steele died on December 21, 1988 from emphysema after a long sickness.

Bob Steele is said to have been the inspiration for the character "Cowboy Bob" in the Dennis The Menace comic strip.

His obvious acting talent in his school  dramatic club led him to leading roles in most of the school plays. At  6'' 0" and 180 pounds, Dix excelled in sports, especially football and  baseball. These skills would serve him well in the vigorous film roles  he would go on to play. After a year at the University of Minnesota he  took a position at a bank, spending his evenings training for the stage.  His professional start was with a local stock company, and this led to  similar work in New York. The death of his father left him with a mother  and sister to support. He went to Los Angeles, became leading man for  the Morosco Stock Company and his success there got him a contract with  Paramount Pictures. His rugged good looks and dark features made him a  popular player in westerns. His athletic ability led to his starring  role in Paramount''s Warming Up  (1928), a baseball story and also the studio''s first feature with  synchronized score and sound effects. His deep voice and commanding  presence were perfectly suited for the talkies, and he was signed by RKO  Radio Pictures in 1929, scoring an early triumph in the all-talking  mystery drama, Seven Keys to Baldpate (1929).

In that same year, she recorded Angiolini, which contained ten tracks including "Tu sei", "Ti stravoglio", "Buoni Amici" and "Aspettavo te" (released in 1997 as "We Can Break Away" by the Belgian pop duo Indiana in an English adaptation by Michael Leahy).

She continued recording until 1997, both in Italy and in Spain. Her last musical production In canto was released in 1999 but not in Spanish. It sold about 35,000 copies in Italy.

She also continued her television hosting career in programmess like Generazione X, Super, Non dimenticate lo spazzolino da denti, Cominciamo bene estate. In the 2000s, she became an MTV host for programmes like Stasera niente MTC.

Ambra Angiolini is now an actress; she won the Nastro d''Argento, the David di Donatello and the Ciak d''oro alla rivelazione dell''anno for her role in Saturno contro (2007) directed by Ferzan Özpetek.[3] She starred in Bianco e Nero (2008) directed by Cristina Comencini.

Edith Norma Shearer (August 10, 1902 – June 12, 1983) was a Canadian-American actress. Shearer was one of the most popular actresses in North America from the mid-1920s through the 1930s. Her early films cast her as the girl next door, but for most of the Pre-Code film era, beginning with the 1930 film The Divorcee, for which she won an Oscar for Best Actress, she played sexually liberated women in sophisticated contemporary comedies. Later she appeared in historical and period films.

Unlike many of her MGM contemporaries, Shearer''s fame declined steeply after retirement. By the time of her death in 1983, she was largely remembered at best for her "noble" roles in The Women, Marie Antoinette, and Romeo and Juliet. Shearer''s legacy began to be re-evaluated in the 1990s with the publication of two biographies and the TCM (Turner Classic Movies) and VHS release of her films, many of them unseen since the implementation of the Production Code some sixty years before. Focus shifted to her pre-Code "divorcee" persona, and Shearer was rediscovered as "the exemplar of sophisticated [1930''s] woman-hood... exploring love and sex with an honesty that would be considered frank by modern standards".

Simultaneously, Shearer''s ten-year collaboration with portrait photographer George Hurrell and her lasting contribution to fashion through the designs of Adrian were also recognized.

Shearer is widely celebrated by some as one of cinema''s feminist pioneers: "the first American film actress to make it chic and acceptable to be single and not a virgin on screen". In March 2008, two of her most famous pre-code films, The Divorcee and A Free Soul, were released on DVD.

George Herman Ruth, Jr. (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948), best known as "Babe" Ruth and nicknamed "the Bambino" and "the Sultan of Swat", was an American Major League baseball player from 1914–1935. Ruth originally broke into the major leagues with the Boston Red Sox as a starting pitcher, but after he was sold to the New York Yankees in 1919, he converted to a full-time right fielder and subsequently became one of the league''s most prolific hitters. Ruth was a mainstay in the Yankees'' lineup that won seven pennants and four World Series titles during his tenure with the team. After a short stint with the Boston Braves in 1935, Ruth retired. In 1936, Ruth became one of the first five players elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Ruth has since become regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture. He has been named the greatest baseball player in history in various surveys and rankings, and his home run hitting prowess and charismatic personality made him a larger than life figure in the "Roaring Twenties". Off the field he was famous for his charity, but also was noted for his often reckless lifestyle. Ruth is credited with changing baseball itself. The popularity of the game exploded in the 1920s, largely due to his influence. Ruth ushered in the "live-ball era", as his big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only excited fans, but helped baseball evolve from a low-scoring, speed-dominated game to a high-scoring power game.

In 1998, The Sporting News ranked Ruth number one on the list of "Baseball''s 100 Greatest Players". In 1999, baseball fans named Ruth to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 1969, he was named baseball''s Greatest Player Ever in a ballot commemorating the 100th anniversary of professional baseball. In 1993, the Associated Press reported that Muhammad Ali was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athletes, out of over 800 dead or alive athletes, in America. The study found that over 97% of Americans over 12 years of age identified both Ali and Ruth. According to ESPN, he was the first true American sports celebrity superstar whose fame transcended baseball. In a 1999 ESPN poll, he was ranked as the third-greatest US athlete of the century, behind Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali.

Ruth was the first player to hit 60 home runs in one season (1927), setting the season record which stood until broken by Roger Maris in 1961. Ruth''s lifetime total of 714 home runs at his retirement in 1935 was a record, until first surpassed by Hank Aaron in 1974. Unlike many power hitters, Ruth also hit for average: his .342 lifetime batting is tenth highest in baseball history, and in one season (1923) he hit .393, a Yankee record. His .690 career slugging percentage and 1.164 career on-base plus slugging (OPS) remain the Major League records. Ruth dominated the era in which he played. He led the league in home runs during a season twelve times, slugging percentage and OPS thirteen times each, runs scored eight times, and runs batted in (RBIs) six times. Each of those totals represents a modern record (as well as the all-time record, except for RBIs).

He was born May 7, 1885, the third of seven children, in the Hayes Hotel (owned by his father) in the tiny hamlet of Stannards, New York, on the outskirts of Wellsville, New York. Hayes was the son of hotelier and oil-production manager Clark Hayes, and grew up in Stannards. As a young man, George Hayes worked in a circus and played semi-pro baseball while a teenager. He ran away from home at 17, in 1902, and joined a touring stock company. He married Olive Ireland in 1914 and the pair became quite successful on the vaudeville circuit. Retired in his 40s, he lost much of his money in the 1929 stock market crash and was forced to return to work. Although he had made his film debut in a single appearance prior to the crash, it was not until his wife convinced him to move to California and he met producer Trem Carr that he began working steadily in the medium. He played scores of roles in Westerns and non-Westerns alike, finally in the mid-1930s settling in to an almost exclusively Western career. He gained fame as Hopalong Cassidy''s sidekick Windy Halliday in many films between 1936-39. Leaving the Cassidy films in a salary dispute, he was legally precluded from using the "Windy" nickname, and so took on the sobriquet "Gabby", and was so billed from about 1940. One of the few sidekicks to land on the annual list of Top Ten Western Boxoffice Stars, he did so repeatedly. In his early films, he alternated between whiskered comic-relief sidekicks and clean-shaven bad guys, but by the later 1930s, he worked almost exclusively as a Western sidekick to stars such as John Wayne, Roy Rogers, and Randolph Scott. After his last film, in 1950, he starred as the host of a network television show devoted to stories of the Old West for children, The Gabby Hayes Show (1950). Offstage an elegant and well-appointed connoisseur and man-about-town, Hayes devoted the final years of his life to his investments.

Edwin Stafford Nelson (born December 21, 1928) is an American actor.

Nelson has appeared in numerous television shows, more than fifty motion pictures, and hundreds of stage productions. Until 2005, he was teaching acting and screenwriting in his native New Orleans at two local universities there. Hurricane Katrina prompted him to move his family to Sterlington near Monroe in Ouachita Parish in northeastern Louisiana.

Nelson began acting while attending Tulane University in New Orleans. He left college after two years to study at the New York School of Radio and Television Technique. After graduating, he took a position as a director at WDSU-TV in New Orleans. By 1956, acting became his central focus and he moved to the Los Angeles area. Early in his career he worked with famed B-movie producer Roger Corman on such Corman films as Cry Baby Killers, A Bucket of Blood, Teenage Cave Man and Attack of the Crab Monsters. In 1958 he participated in Bruno VeSota''s science fiction horror film The Brain Eaters.

His early television career featured many guest starring roles in such series as The Fugitive, Gunsmoke, Harbor Command, Tombstone Territory, Tightrope, The Blue Angels (as arrogant flight instructor Lieutenant Dayl Martin), Laramie, COronado 9, The Eleventh Hour, Bonanza, Thriller (US TV series), and Channing, an ABC drama about college life.

In 1964 he won his most famous role portraying Dr. Michael Rossi on the ABC drama Peyton Place, which ran from 1964 to 1969. Nelson''s fellow cast members included Mia Farrow, Ryan O''Neal, and Dorothy Malone. Dr. Rossi proved to be so popular that by 1968, he became the lead actor on the show. Nelson reprised his role in two made-for-TV movies, Murder in Peyton Place and Peyton Place: The Next Generation.

After Peyton Place ended, Nelson worked in many more productions of all varieties, including starring role in many movies of the week, a second TV series, "The Silent Force," and a popular morning talk show which he hosted for three years.

Soon after, Nelson struck gold with his critically acclaimed portrayal of elusive pit crew chief Robert Denby in the hit film Riding with Death (1976), earning him several prestigious accolades and legions of devoted fans.

He portrayed a dangerous impostor in the adventure movie For the Love of Benji (1977).

During the 1980s, Nelson took on the role of Senator Mark Denning in the daytime soap Capitol.

Nelson also spent a couple of years as Harry Truman onstage replacing James Whitmore for the National Tour of "Give ''Em Hell, Harry."

While living in Los Angeles, Nelson was an active member of the Screen Actors Guild and was elected to the union board for many years. Nelson is a long-standing member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and continues a long tradition of participation in voting for the Academy Awards.

In 1999, Nelson returned to Tulane University to finish credits toward his undergraduate degree, which he completed the following year at the age of seventy-one. Nelson continues to act as the opportunity arises. He and his wife of fifty-eight years, Patsy, enjoy semi-retirement visiting his six children and fourteen grandchildren.

Louise Beavers (March 8, 1902 – October 26, 1962) was an American film and television actress. Beavers appeared in dozens of films and two hit television shows from the 1920s until 1960, most often cast in the role of a maid, servant, or slave. She was a native of Cincinnati, Ohio, and a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, one of the four African-American sororities.

Beavers was a breakthrough actress for black women and became known as a symbol of a “mammy” on the screen. A mammy archetype "is the portrayal within a narrative framework or other imagery of a black domestic servant, generally good-natured, often overweight, and loud".

Louise Beavers started her career in the 1920s. At the time, black people in films were limited to acting in only very few roles, usually as slaves or domestic help. She played the "mammy" in many of the movies she acted in. She started to gain more attention in the acting world after she played the role of Julia in Coquette, which starred Mary Pickford. In this film she played the black maid and mother figure to a young white woman.

She once received a review which stated:  "Personally, Miss Beavers is just splendid, just as fine as she appears on screen, but she also has a charm all her own, which needs no screen role for recognition. She has a very pleasing personality, one that draws people to her instantly and makes them feel that they are meeting a friend instead of a Hollywood Star.”

Beavers had an attractive personality, and often played roles in which she helps a white protagonist mature in the course of the movie. In most of Beavers'' movies, her role was written such that she would serve, as often black characters did, a fund, “of servitude and/or comic relief”.

Louise Beavers with Bobby Breen in Rainbow on the River (1936)

In 1934, Beavers played Delilah in Imitation of Life in a dramatic role. Her character again plays a black maid, but instead of the usual stereotypical comedic or purely functional role, Delilah''s story line is a secondary parallel plot. The public reacted positively to Beavers'' performance. It was not only a breakthrough for Beavers, but was also “the first time in American cinema history that a black woman''s problems were given major emotional weight in a major Hollywood motion picture”. Some in the media recognized the unfairness of Hollywood''s double standard regarding race. For example, California Graphic Magazine wrote, “the Academy could not recognize Miss Beavers. She is black!”

In the 1942 movie Holiday Inn, in the performance of "Lincoln''s Birthday," there was a big minstrel show number, "Abraham," which featured performances by Bing Crosby (Jim Hardy) in blackface makeup and by Beavers as Mamie. This number, as well as the scene itself, are sometimes cut from the film''s show on television, presumably because of the offensiveness of blackface.

In later life, Beavers was plagued by health issues, including diabetes. She died on October 26, 1962, at the age of 60, following a heart attack, at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles.

His uncle, Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, may have helped him in his early days at Mack Sennett Studios, but talent kept him working. He was slender, sandy-haired, handsome and a remarkable acrobat.

St. John frequently appeared as Arbuckle''s mischievously villainous rival for the attentions of leading ladies like Mabel Normand, and worked with Arbuckle and Charles Chaplin in The Rounders (1914). The most critically praised film from St. John''s period with Arbuckle remains Fatty and Mabel Adrift (1916) with Normand.

The name Fuzzy originally belonged to a different actor, John Forrest “Fuzzy“ Knight, who took on the role of cowboy sidekick before St. John. As the studio first intended to hire Knight for the western series but then gave the role to St. John instead, he took on the nickname of his rival for his screen character.

In most of his films, screen time was set aside for St. John to do a sort of solo comedy act, emphasizing amazing pratfalls and acrobatics. He might "find" a bicycle on a fairground set, and do an astonishing sequence of acrobatic stunts on the cycle, or he might try to capture a rat, bat, skunk, gopher, or bug with hilarious and chaotic consequences. Another stunt which he used in nearly every Western was virtually his trademark: he would mount his horse in apparently the standard manner, but somehow wind up sitting facing backward, and often would ride off with the hero in this unusual orientation.

When Crabbe left PRC (according to interviews, in disgust at their increasingly low budgets), St. John was paired with new star Lash LaRue. Ultimately, St. John made more than 80 Westerns as Fuzzy. His last film was released in 1952. From that time on until his death in 1963 in Lyons, Georgia, he made personal appearances at fairs and rodeos, and travelled with the Tommy Scott Wild West Show. Altogether, Al St. John acted in 346 movies, spanning four decades from 1912 to 1952.

Stan Laurel (born Arthur Stanley Jefferson, 16 June 1890 – 23 February 1965) was an English comic actor, writer, and film director who was part of the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy. He appeared with his comedy partner Oliver Hardy in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles.

Laurel began his career in music hall, where he developed a number of his standard comic devices, including the bowler hat, the deep comic gravity, and the nonsensical understatement. His performances polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches. He was a member of "Fred Karno''s Army", where he was Charlie Chaplin''s understudy. He and Chaplin arrived in the United States on the same ship from the United Kingdom with the Karno troupe.

Laurel began his film career in 1917 and made his final appearance in 1951. From 1928 onwards he appeared exclusively with Hardy, and Laurel officially retired from the screen following his comedy partner''s death in 1957.

In 1961 Laurel was given a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award for his pioneering work in comedy, and he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Blvd.

Jimmy Conlin (October 14, 1884 – May 7, 1962) was an American character actor who appeared in almost 150 films in his 32-year career.  Conlin was born in Camden, New Jersey in 1884, and his acting career started out in vaudeville, where he and his first wife Myrtle Glass played the Keith-Albee-Orpheum circuits billed as "Conlin & Glass", a song-and-dance team. They also starred together in two short films, Sharps and Flats (1928) and Zip! Boom! Bang! (1929) for Vitaphone.

Conlin made another comedy short without Glass in 1930 (A Tight Squeeze), but his film career started for good in 1933, and for the next 27 years, with the single exception of 1951, every year saw the release of at least one film in which Conlin appeared – at the height of his career, often more than a dozen of them. Recognizable by his small size and odd appearance, Conlin played all sorts of small roles and bit parts, many times not receiving an onscreen credit.

In the 1940s, Conlin was part of Preston Sturges'' unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in nine films written and directed by Sturges. His roles in Sturges'' films were often sizable and often came with good billing. One of his best performances came in Sturges'' The Sin of Harold Diddlebock in 1946, when he played "Wormy", the racetrack tout who convinces Harold Lloyd to have his first drink, setting off the events of the film. The loyalty between Sturges and Conlin ran both ways, and when the former golden boy of Hollywood fell on hard times, Conlin remained a friend, stayed in contact, and helped out in any way he could.

Conlin did not make many television appearances, but he did have a regular role as a bartender on Duffy''s Tavern, a syndicated series from 1954.

The son of a professor, Brecher began studying philosophy in 1900 at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. He did not finish his studies, deciding to become an actor. He appeared on several provincial stages in Germany and Austria until 1910, and then played in Vienna on various occasions, directed by Josef Jarno until 1921.

In 1919 he was co-founder of the Freie Jüdische Volksbühne in Vienna, a Yiddish theatre, which existed for three years.

Then, in 1921, he moved to New York to act on Broadway. He moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s to appear in foreign-language versions of American films. In the mid-1930s he appeared in classic horror films The Black Cat, Werewolf of London, The Black Room, Mark of the Vampire and The Devil-Doll, and worked steadily in the espionage films of the 1930s/40s, his Slavic accent landing him roles both noble and villainous.

Her first major role, billed as Nana Martinez, was in a Hopalong Cassidy movie The Eagle''s Brood. Woodbury appeared in 15 films from 1934 through 1935, of which 10 were uncredited.

In 1936, her career began to become more successful, with appearances in eight films that year, of which five were uncredited. However, of the three roles that were credited, Woodbury made an impact, and caught the attention of studios. Her mixture of Danish, British, and Native American heritage gave her an exotic appearance, and allowed her to be cast in many different ethnicities, from Hispanic to French and Asian. By 1937, her career had taken off, mostly in B-movies such as Living on Love and Bulldog Courage, but also with her receiving many credited roles.

In 1937, Woodbury starred in her first of several credited Charlie Chan films, titled Charlie Chan on Broadway. She also began appearing in numerous Westerns, portraying the heroine opposite some of the 1930s'' biggest cowboy actors, to include William Boyd of Hopalong Cassidy fame, Roy Rogers, and Johnny Mack Brown. Woodbury appeared in 50 films from 1937 to 1945, almost all of which were credited. Her most memorable of that period was her lead role in the serial Brenda Starr, Reporter, in 1945.

Born just after the turn of the century in Louisiana, Mantan began running away from home at age 12 to join circuses and medicine shows, only to be brought back time and again. During these times he sharpened his comic skills and developed routines and acts that eventually became popular on the vaudeville stage, or what was then called the "chitlin'' circuit." A solo performer by nature, he often teamed up with other famous comics (such as Ben Carter) to keep working, and became a deft performer of "indefinite talk" routines, where two quicksilver comics continually topped each other in mid-sentence, as if reading each other''s mind (i.e., "Say, did you see...?" "Saw him just yesterday...didn''t look so good"). Mantan''s focus gradually shifted his trade toward film, where he initially appeared in servile bits (shoeshine men, porters, waiters). However, his talent for making people laugh couldn''t be overlooked and he soon earned featured status in Harlem-styled western parodies and grade "A" comedy films playing the superstitious, ever-terrified manservant running from any kind of impending doom.

Moreland''s peak in movies came with his recurring role as Birmingham, the skittish chauffeur, in the "Charlie Chan" series, where he was forever forewarning his boss to stay away from an obviously dangerous case or situation. Though haunted mansions were an ideal place for setting off his stereotyped character, Mantan would be haunted in a different way by this Hollywood success in years to follow. By the 1950s, racial attitudes began to change and, with the rise of the civil rights movement, what was once considered hilarious was now interpreted as demeaning and offensive to both blacks and whites. Mantan and others, such as Stepin Fetchit, were ostracized and ridiculed by Hollywood for their past negative portrayals. It took decades for audiences to forgive and newer generations to forget the Depression-era comedy of Mantan Moreland in order for the actor to come back.

In the late 1960s he managed a modest resurgence on TV and in commercials and occasional films, allowing him to work again with such comic heavyweights as Bill Cosby, Godfrey Cambridge and director Carl Reiner. It was all too brief, however, for Mantan, long suffering from ill health, died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1973, just as he was settling in to his renewed popularity. Today, audiences tend to be kinder and more understanding of Moreland, remembering him as a highly talented comic who, in the only way he knew, broke major barriers and opened the doors for others black actors to follow.', 'Monroe, Louisiana, USA', 1, '/B9nFE1tk7M8Q3nWrExchp2QRIy.jpg'),

For example, her mother enrolled her in school early so she  could have a head start. Sandy was only four years old when she entered  the second grade. Sandra was an extremely pretty young lady, which  enabled her to get into modeling. In fact, she was already very  successful at her craft by the time she was 12 years old. This in turn  led to television commercials for local companies, an added benefit for  the young model. Through her mother''s prodding and the talent scouts,  Sandra was signed to do a movie when she was 14 called Until They Sail  (1957), released in 1957. While the film didn''t exactly top the charts,  it would lay the foundation for Sandra''s career. The new young actress  was then signed to two more films for 1958, The Reluctant Debutante (1958) and The Restless Years (1958), the latter with a young actor, John Saxon. In 1959, Sandra appeared in five productions with Gidget (1959) and A Summer Place  (1959) being the two most popular. Sandra was 17 years old and becoming  the heartthrob of teenage boys all across America. In 1960, Sandra  appeared in only one film, Portrait in Black (1960), but is remembered by her for something else. She married teen idol Bobby Darin  in December of that year. It may have sunk a few teen boys'' hearts, but  most still were enamored of her. Her work, once again, took off. The  1961 releases were Come September (1961), Romanoff and Juliet (1961), and as Tammy Tyree in Tammy Tell Me True (1961). Sandra had replaced the ever-popular Debbie Reynolds in the "Tammy" series, but the film and its 1963 sequel, Tammy and the Doctor (1963), didn''t do all that well at the box-office. The films were now slowing for Sandra. The last few that she made were I''d Rather Be Rich (1964), That Funny Feeling (1965), A Man Could Get Killed (1966), Doctor, You''ve Got to Be Kidding! (1967), and Rosie! (1967). Her career was effectively over at age 26.

Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname "Nuclear Wintour".

She is the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, editor of the London Evening Standard. Anna became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later she moved to the United States, with stints at New York and House & Garden. She returned home for a year to turn around British Vogue, and later assumed control of the franchise''s magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.

A former personal assistant, Lauren Weisberger, wrote the 2003 bestselling roman à clef The Devil Wears Prada, later made into a successful film starring Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a fashion editor widely believed to be based on Wintour.

She is probably best known to American audiences for her role as housekeeper Mrs. Pearce in My Fair Lady (1964). She also appeared as the stern and caustic Mrs. Bramson in the remake of Night Must Fall (also 1964), and the matron in the film If.... (1968).

She appeared at both the Royal Court Theatre in London and on Broadway in 1970 in David Storey''s Home. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play.

He was best known for his starring role in Tom Corbett, Space Cadet.

He was only 11 when he accompanied his mother to a casting office, where he stood in the background while his mother asked about possible openings in new Broadway shows. The agent replied, "I have nothing that suits you, Mona, but I can use the boy." Thomas wound up in a small part in Carry Nation (1932), where Jimmy Stewart was cast as a constable. Thomas appeared in six other Broadway plays between 1932 and 1936, including Little Ol'' Boy with Burgess Meredith, Thunder on the Left, Wednesday''s Child, The First Legion, Remember the Day, in which he appeared with his father, and Seen But Not Heard.

In Wednesday''s Child he played the role of Bobby Phillips, the longest stage part ever written for a child performer. Thomas also developed a lifelong fascination with the character of Sherlock Holmes during this period, when he saw William Gillette perform the part during his farewell tour.

Thomas''s last "A" film was Boys'' Town (1938) with Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney. Thomas was Freddy Fuller, Boys'' Town''s mayor, and was not asked to appear in the sequel, Men of Boys'' Town (1941). He then appeared in a string of "B" films such as Little Tough Guys in Society and Nancy Drew... Detective (both 1938), Nancy Drew... Reporter, Code of the Streets, Nancy Drew… Trouble Shooter, The Angels Wash Their Faces, Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase, On Dress Parade and Invisible Stripes (all 1939).

In 1941 Thomas had small parts in Flying Cadets and One Foot in Heaven. His last film roles were small roles in Always in My Heart and The Major and the Minor (1942), where he played a military school cadet who flirted with Ginger Rogers'' character.  After World War II, Thomas moved into television.

Joseph Edward Bromberg (born Josef Bromberger, December 25, 1903 – December 6, 1951) was a Romanian-born American character actor in motion picture and stage productions dating mostly from the 1930s and 1940s.  By virtue of his physique, the short, somewhat rotund actor was destined to play secondary roles. Bromberg made his stage debut at the Greenwich Village Playhouse and in 1926 made his first appearance in a Broadway play, Princess Turandot. The following year, Bromberg married Goldie Doberman, with whom he had three children.

Occasionally credited as J.E. Bromberg'' and Joseph Bromberg, he performed secondary roles in 35 Broadway productions and 53 motion pictures until 1951. For two decades, Bromberg was highly regarded in the New York theatrical world and was a founding member of the Civic Repertory Theatre (1928–1930) and of the Group Theatre (1931–1940).

Bromberg made his screen debut in 1936 under contract to Twentieth Century-Fox. The versatile actor played a wide variety of roles ranging from a ruthless New York newspaper editor (in Charlie Chan on Broadway) to a despotic Arabian sheik (in Mr. Moto Takes a Chance). Although he spoke with no trace of an accent, he was often called upon to play humble immigrants of various nationalities. When Warner Oland, the actor who played Charlie Chan, died in 1938, Fox considered Bromberg as a suitable replacement, but the role ultimately went to Sidney Toler. Fox began loaning Bromberg to other studios in 1939 and finally dropped him from the roster in 1941. He kept working for various producers, including a stint at Universal Pictures in the mid-1940s.

Bromberg''s most outstanding attribute was his facility with sensitive character roles; he could take a standard, undistinguished supporting part and make it unforgettably sympathetic. In Hollywood Cavalcade he portrays Don Ameche''s friend who knows he will never get the girl; in Three Sons he is the lowly business associate who longs to be given a partnership; in Easy to Look At he is the once-great couturier now reduced to night watchman.

In September 1950, the anti-communist magazine Red Channels accused Bromberg of being a member of the American Communist Party. Subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in June 1951, Bromberg refused to answer any questions in accordance with his Fifth Amendment rights.', 'Temesvár, Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary', 1, '/l9OUS1NA2Wt2O6oP9Dk5gga7SiW.jpg'),

He is currently under contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he is a former four-time TNA World Heavyweight Champion, and recognized by the promotion as a 14-time World Champion (as they also include his amateur accolades). He is also known for his time in World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (WWF/E).

Angle was involved in amateur wrestling during both high school and college. In college at Clarion University of Pennsylvania, he won numerous accolades, including being a two-time National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I champion. After graduating, he won the 1995 World Championship tournament. Angle then competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, where he won a gold medal in heavyweight freestyle wrestling. Kurt Angle is also one of only four people in the world to complete the Grand Slam in amateur wrestling which is the junior nationals, the NCAAs, the World Championships and the Olympics. He is also one of only four americans to win the Krasnoyarsk. He was named the greatest shoot wrestler and one of the top 15 college wrestlers of all time by USA Wrestling.

Initially turning down an offer to join the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Angle signed a multi-year contract with the company in 1998. His first big push in the company was in February 2000, when he held both the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship at the same time. Not long after, Angle began pursuing the WWF Championship. He continued to be a part of main event matches until August 2006, when Angle was granted a release from his contract. Throughout his tenure in the company, he was a six-time world champion (four-time WWF/E Champion, World Heavyweight Champion and WCW Champion), he also held the United States Championship, Intercontinental Championship, European Championship, Hardcore Championship and WWE Tag Team Champion once each. In addition, he was the winner of the King of the Ring tournament in 2000, the tenth Triple Crown Champion, and the fifth Grand Slam Champion. In addition, he is one of two wrestlers (Edge being the other) to have held every currently active male championship in the WWE.

After leaving WWE, Angle joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he became the second wrestler in TNA to win TNA''s Triple Crown and the first man to hold all three TNA championships simultaneously. While in TNA, his real-life wife Karen began accompanying him to the ring and playing a part in his on-screen storylines. Angle has also made appearances for New Japan Pro Wrestling as well as Inoki Genome Federation, where he held their version of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. In addition, he is a three-time TNA World Heavyweight Champion, the second Triple Crown winner in TNA history—being the only one to hold all the required titles at once (while also holding the IWGP Title, making him a quadruple champion for a brief time).

Angle is the only wrestler in history to be a Triple Crown winner in both WWE and TNA. He is the first man to have held the WWE Championship, the World Heavyweight Championship, the WCW Championship, and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in his career. Angle is also a two time King of the Mountain winner, winning at the 2007 and 2009 Slammiversary PPV event, making him the only wrestler to have been both King of the Ring (WWE) and King of the Mountain (TNA). Between WWE and TNA, Angle has won 17 total championships. In 2010 the Wrestling Observer Newsletter named Angle the Wrestler of the Decade of the 2000s

Monte Blue (January 11, 1887 – February 18, 1963) was a movie actor who began his career as a romantic leading man in the silent film era, and later progressed to character roles.

Blue was born as Gerard Montgomery Bluefeather in Indianapolis, Indiana. His father was half French, half Cherokee Indian. One of five children, his father died and his mother could not raise five children alone. Along with another brother, they both admitted to the Indiana Soldiers'' and Sailors'' Children''s Home. This did not stop him working his way through to Purdue University.

When growing up, Blue built up his physique to become a football player (he grew to six feet three inches tall). He not only played football, but he was also a fireman, railroad worker, coal miner, cowpuncher, ranch hand, circus rider, lumberjack, and finally, a day laborer at the studios of D. W. Griffith.

He had no theatrical experience when he came to the screen. In his first movie, The Birth of a Nation (1915), he was a stuntman and an extra in the movie. In his next movie, he starred in another small part in the movie, Intolerance (1916). Gradually moving to supporting roles for both D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille, Blue earned his breakthrough role as Danton in Orphans of the Storm, starring sisters, Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. Then he rose to stardom as a rugged romantic lead along with top leading actresses such as Clara Bow, Gloria Swanson, and Norma Shearer. His most prolific female screen partner was Marie Prevost with whom he made several films in the mid 20s at Warner Brothers. Blue''s finest silent screen performance was as the alcoholic doctor who finds paradise in MGM''s White Shadows in the South Seas (1928). Blue became one of the few silent stars to survive the talkie revolution. However, he lost his investments in the stock market crash of 1929.

He rebuilt his career as a character actor, working until his retirement in 1954. One of his more memorable roles was the sheriff in Key Largo. He divorced his first wife in 1923 and married Tova Jansen in 1924. He had two children, Barbara Ann and Richard Monte. During the later part of his life, Monte Blue was an active Mason and the advance man for the Hamid-Morton Shrine Circus; while on business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he had a heart attack because of complications from influenza, dying at age 76.

Monte Blue has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6286 Hollywood Blvd.

Lane Chandler (June 4, 1899 – September 14, 1972) was an American actor specializing in Westerns.

In the early 1920s he moved to Los Angeles, California, and started working as an auto mechanic. His real-life experiences growing up on a horse ranch landed him bit parts in westerns from 1925, for Paramount Pictures. Studio executives suggested changing his name to Lane Chandler, and as such he began achieving leading roles opposite stars like Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, Betty Bronson and Esther Ralston. His first lead role was in The Legion of the Condemned.

As a silent film star Chandler performed well, but when talkies arrived he was cast more in supporting roles, as in The Great Mike of 1944. He starred in a few low-budget westerns in the 1930s, but was more often cast as the leading man''s partner, or saddle pal, or a sheriff or army officer. With the advent of television Chandler began making appearance on numerous series, often making appearances in Westerns such as The Lone Ranger, The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, Lawman, Have Gun – Will Travel, Rawhide, Maverick, Cheyenne, and Gunsmoke. He continued acting on TV and in films through 1966, retiring comfortably due to his holdings in both residential and commercial properties.

He died in Los Angeles of heart disease in 1972, aged 73.

Mario Gabriele Andretti (born February 28, 1940) is a retired Italian American world champion racing driver, one of the most successful Americans in the history of the sport. He is one of only two drivers to win races in Formula One, IndyCar, World Sportscar Championship and NASCAR (the other being Dan Gurney). He also won races in midget cars, sprint cars, and drag racing.

During his career, Andretti won four IndyCar titles (three under USAC-sanctioning, one under CART), the 1978 Formula One World Championship, and IROC VI. To date, he remains the only driver ever to win the Indianapolis 500 (1969), Daytona 500 (1967) and the Formula One World Championship, and, along with Juan Pablo Montoya, the only driver to have won a race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Formula One, and an Indianapolis 500. No American has won a Formula One race since Andretti''s victory at the 1978 Dutch Grand Prix. Andretti had 109 career wins on major circuits.

Andretti had a long career in racing. He was the only person to be named United States Driver of the Year in three decades (1967, 1978, and 1984). He was also one of only three drivers to win races on road courses, paved ovals, and dirt tracks in one season, a feat that he accomplished four times. With his final IndyCar win in April 1993, Andretti became the first driver to win IndyCar races in four different decades and the first to win automobile races of any kind in five.

In American popular culture, his name has become synonymous with speed, similar to Barney Oldfield in the early twentieth century and Stirling Moss in the United Kingdom.

Throughout his acting career, both on stage and in film, he was typecast as "the attractive, reliable love interest of the heroine," or "the tall, stalwart hero."

Born and raised in Massachusetts, he attended Bates College, before working as a teacher. He was tapped to act in his first film in 1938, which convinced him to move to Hollywood, California. His second film–Four Daughters (1938)–propelled him into national fame sparking three sequels: Daughters Courageous (1939), Four Wives (1939) and Four Mothers (1941) with Lynn reprising his role in each of them. He was at the center of the Gone with the Wind (1939) screening controversy; he was noted as the top contender to play Ashley Wilkes, however, the directer eventually chose Leslie Howard instead. Lynn was asked to join James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart in The Roaring Twenties (1939), a gangster noir that garnered him critical praise. His success continued with such films as The Fighting 69th (1940) in which he portrayed poet-soldier Joyce Kilmer opposite Cagney, It All Came True (1940), All This and Heaven Too (1940) and Million Dollar Baby (1941).

His movie career was put on hold for World War II draft, where he received a Bronze Star for his service as a in Italy and Austria as a combat intelligence captain. He returned to the screen in 1948 and was in the notably successful, A Letter to Three Wives (1949), which went on to be nominated of best picture in the 1950 prime time Academy Awards. A year later he joined that cast of Home Town Story (1951) billed alongside Marilyn Monroe. His later film career credits include: BUtterfield 8 (1960) along with Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey, and Tony Rome (1967) with Frank Sinatra.

Lynn also began to act on Broadway and was featured in such plays as Any Wednesday (1966) and Dinner at Eight (1967). Later on in his career he found mixed critical success television starring in hit shows such as Robert Montgomery Presents, Your Show of Shows, My Son Jeep (with young Martin Huston), and Lux Video Theatre.

Other stage credits include the role of Donna in the Broadway show Hurly Burly from 1985, and Off Broadway in Jersey City (1990).

In September 1985, her agent presented her with a "day player role" of Gina, one of Gordon''s science students. Despite "warm feelings towards the show", she passed on the part, having been convinced she''d permanently maintain her tough girl typecasting; a rejection from Sesame Street would "sting too much", and destroy its place in her mind. Her agent urged her into an audition, and she credits show directorJon Stone for seeing past her self-depreciation. In 1991, she starred in the ABC After-School Special It''s Only Rock and Roll, where she met her husband to be, writer/director Harry O''Reilly; at this point, she began receiving credit on Sesame Street under her married name, Alison Bartlett O''Reilly. She also guest starred on NYPD Blue in 1995. Taking time off to have three children, O''Reilly''s work was primarily limited to Sesame Street.

However, in 2002, she began actively seeking other roles. In addition to appearing in the 2003 independent film Crooked Lines (directed by her husband), the actress began appearing in a variety of roles in different TV crime dramas, including the short-lived FOX series The Jury, various episodes in the Law & Order franchise series, and a two episode stint on HBO''s The Sopranos as Gwen McIntyre, a maternal woman who has fallen in love with an ex-con (Steve Buscemi''s Tony Blundatto). The appearance on the controversial series was cleared with Children''s Television Workshop, and the actress'' contract carefully restricted what words the character would say and how much skin would be shown. "It''s a good thing my children go to bed at 8 o''clock," she said in a 2005 interview. In 2006, she appeared in several episodes of the FX show "Rescue Me" as Deb Stackhouse, the wife of a firefighter injured in a fire. In 2008, she appeared in a national commercial for the asthma medication Advair.', 'New York City - New York - USA', 1, '/xjuRRpGWOxhrRIALP3cHNnepLwN.jpg'),

Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. (December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver, was an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, activist, and humanitarian, whose greatest commercial success was as a solo singer.

After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career with folk music groups during the late 1960s.

Starting in the 1970s, he was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists. By 1974, he was one of America''s best-selling performers, and AllMusic has described Denver as "among the most beloved entertainers of his era".

Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed, with total sales of over 33 million records worldwide. He recorded and performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, his disdain for city life, his enthusiasm for music, and his relationship trials.

Denver''s music appeared on a variety of charts, including country music, the Billboard Hot 100, and adult contemporary, in all earning 12 gold and four platinum albums with his signature songs "Take Me Home, Country Roads", "Annie''s Song", "Rocky Mountain High", "Calypso", "Thank God I''m a Country Boy", and "Sunshine on My Shoulders".

Denver appeared in several films and television specials during the 1970s and 1980s.

He continued to record in the 1990s, also focusing on environmental issues by lending vocal support to space exploration and testifying in front of Congress in protest against censorship in music.

He lived in Aspen, Colorado for much of his life and was known for his love of Colorado, which he sang about numerous times. In 1974 Denver was named poet laureate of the state. The Colorado state legislature also adopted "Rocky Mountain High" as one of its two state songs in 2007.

Denver was an avid pilot who died at the age of 53 in a single-fatality crash while flying his experimental Rutan Long-EZ canard aircraft.', 'Roswell, New Mexico, USA', 1, '/eu9H6vXW50lLm7LzJCqCWQicSDk.jpg'),

He played many tough guy parts from the late 1950s on, joining the Stuntmen''s Association in the late 1960s.

In addition to fisticuffs, his speciality was dying violently on screen. He was a regular stuntman on the World War II TV series "The Rat Patrol" and a double for action actors Sean Connery and William Smith. He helped set up the great fights in "Darker Than Amber" and "Any Which Way You Can", although tough guy Smith ended up doing all his own stunts.

Dimitri was also memorable playing Angie Dickinson''s undead husband in the 1973 cult TV Movie "The Norliss Tapes". He later became a fixture in many of Arnold Schwarzenegger''s films, stood up to Steven Seagal in "Out for Justice", and doubled for the one arm man in the big screen version of "The Fugitive".

Born in Krakow, Poland, in 1940, she was adopted by a Roman Catholic family that found her left in a bundle at a train station during the Holocaust. Her adopted family sent her to be educated in a monastery. Arriving in Israel after World War II with the name Zusia Sobetzcki, she became Miriam Goldberg and continued her schooling in an Orthodox girls'' boarding school.

After becoming enamoured with fashion and undergoing plastic surgery, she was spotted by an American photographer, and ultimately ended up in the Israeli women''s magazine LaIsha. Her new fame launched her to the 1960 national fashion competition, where she won first place and was crowned Miss Israel,[2] though she changed her name to Gila Golan to prevent word getting back to her religiously conservative benefactors. After receiving second place in that year''s Miss World competition as Israel''s representative, she was sent to the United States to raise funds, and she ended up staying there.

Director Stanley Kramer started her film career with the role of Elsa Lutz in his film Ship of Fools, whence she continued to establish herself in Our Man Flint, Three on a Couch, and The Valley of Gwangi. Golan was married and divorced, remarried and widowed, and finally married a third time, and has several children from her three marriages. In recent years she has returned to religion and now runs an investment business.

Dysart has been a regular fixture on Australian television for several decades, frequently appearing in guest-starring roles in drama series and comedies, and in character roles in films and miniseries.

High-profile early roles included appearances in Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, Phoenix Five, and several roles in the Crawford Productions police drama series Homicide, Division 4 and Matlock Police.

In the early 1980s he played what is perhaps his best-known acting role, that of vicious and corrupt prison officer Jock Stewart in Prisoner. In the storyline, after being fired from the prison service Stewart admitted to prisoner Judy Bryant that he was the one responsible for murdering her lesbian lover, fellow prisoner Sharon Gilmour. This revelation brought to a close a murder-mystery storyline in the series but launched a long-running story-arc where Bryant repeatedly escaped from prison in a succession of attempts to exact her revenge on Stewart.

After this Dysart continued in guest-starring television roles in drama series and situation comedies, and appeared in many feature films. His films included The Man from Snowy River (1982), Bliss (1985), Garbo (1992), and Flynn (1996). Television roles of the 1990s included appearances in All Together Now, The Games, State Coroner, Blue Heelers, Something in the Air and Neighbours. He also provided the voice for Captain Griswald in Anthony Lucas'' animated short film The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello (2005).

Starting in the 1990s he appeared in a series of well remembered advertisements for the Yellow Pages where he calls a series of mechanics about his problematic Goggomobil. He was also known for playing a recurring character of a Mafia-boss like butcher in advertisements for Don''s Smallgoods.

In the early 2000s he continued his Goggomobil persona advertising Shannons Insurance. The concept played on the role of a person searching for the car parts as any car enthusiast would. Telstra challenged this in the Supreme Court and Shannons withdrew the advertisements, but continued with Dysart and the accent (which Dysart insisted was his own and could not change). The adverts continue and Shannons Insurance also owns several of the Goggomobil cars which feature regularly in their shows.

Tommy has enjoyed a long friendship and working relationship with director/writer Frank Howson in the movies Backstage, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, What The Moon Saw, Flynn, Crime Time, The Final Stage, The Lucky Country, and their most recent collaboration is the award winning film Remembering Nigel, which also stars Tommy''s wife Joan and son Kole.

She worked various jobs as a file clerk and airline reservations taker while studying with Stella Adler and the Actors Studio. While appearing as a contestant on a television game show, a Universal Studios agent spotted her and placed the young beauty under contract in 1954.  After a few starlet bit parts, Gia earned good notices for her "second lead" role in The Price of Fear (1956), which led to even better love interest parts in The Garment Jungle (1957) with Kerwin Mathews, Don''t Go Near the Water (1957) opposite Glenn Ford, The Two-Headed Spy (1958) paired with Jack Hawkins, The Angry Hills (1959) starring Robert Mitchum, and I Aim at the Stars (1960) [aka I Aim at the Stars] with Curd Jürgens. Her best known film role came as Anna, the Greek resistance fighter, in the classic all-star epic film, The Guns of Navarone (1961).  From there things began to spiral downhill for Gia personally and professionally. Riding on the coattails of her ever-rising glamour and success were those deep-rooted insecurities, and she began to drink heavily as compensation. She eventually lost her contract at Universal due to her unreliability, which forced her to seek work overseas. Her marriage to actor Don Burnett burnt itself out, and, at one point, she threw herself off the Waterloo Bridge in desperation. She would have drowned in the Thames River had a passing cab driver not plucked her out of the water in time. Her alcoholic addiction led to numerous arrests, and her bouts with depression grew so severe that she was forced to undergo frequent psychiatric observations. On April 30, 1972, it all ended for her. Gia was found dead in her Hollywood Hills bedroom of an overdose of alcohol and sleeping pills, another Tinseltown statistic. It was listed as a suicide.

Dylan Carlson (born 1967) is the lead guitarist, lead singer, and only constant member of the Drone doom group Earth.

Carlson was born in Seattle, Washington, United States. His father worked for the Department of Defense, and, as a result, as a child he moved quite frequently, living in Philadelphia, Texas, New Mexico, and New Jersey, before coming back to live in Washington state. He had first become interested in being a rock musician at age 15, inspired by bands such as Molly Hatchet, AC/DC, and Black Sabbath. He also cites The Melvins, and composers La Monte Young and Terry Riley as major influences on his music. It was in Olympia, Washington that he met Slim Moon, Greg Babior, Dave Harwell and Joe Preston, with whom he would later form Earth. During this time, he would often make "sonic collages" with his then roommate Kurt Cobain, whom he had introduced to heroin, and future Bikini Kill member Tobi Vail. From 1991 to 1996, Earth had an ever-changing lineup. Carlson attributes a lack of (full-length) studio album recordings from 1997 to 2005 to "legal and drug problems".

Carlson purchased the shotgun with which Kurt Cobain committed suicide. Carlson has said that he did not believe Cobain to be suicidal at the time, and that Cobain had told him that the gun was for home protection.

Carlson was one of the many people interviewed in the Nick Broomfield documentary Kurt &amp; Courtney (1998). He states he regrets appearing in the film, saying "I was misled about his intentions."

Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1985 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene, having its debut album Bleach released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. After signing with major label DGC Records, the band found breakthrough success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from its second album Nevermind (1991). Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana was labeled "the flagship band" of Generation X, and Cobain hailed as "the spokesman of a generation". Cobain however was often uncomfortable and frustrated, believing his message and artistic vision to have been misinterpreted by the public, with his personal issues often subject to media attention. He challenged Nirvana''s audience with its final studio album In Utero (1993).

During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression, his fame and public image, as well as the professional and lifelong personal pressures surrounding himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle, the victim of what was officially ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. The circumstances of his death have become a topic of public fascination and debate. Since their debut, Nirvana, with Cobain as a songwriter, has sold over 25 million albums in the US alone, and over 50 million worldwide.

A move to Los Angeles in 2004 brought on more theatre, including a production of "The Woolgatherer", in which she directed Anne Dudek (a regular on Mad Men (2007)/Big Love (2006)) and David Dayan Fisher (a regular on 24 (2001)/NCIS (2003)) to great reviews. She then landed her first US movie role as the manipulative, born-again Christian, "Stacy", in Headspace (2005). It was as the wild "Thumper Wint" in the comedy, Sex and Death 101 (2007) (Simon Baker/Winona Ryder), by Heathers (1988) writer Daniel Waters, that the critics began to take note of her talent, citing a unique blend of powerful sexuality and irreverent humor. Working in both LA and London, Exam (2009) was next, BAFTA-nominated as Outstanding British Debut and winner of Best Independent at the Santa Barbara Film Fest, the film''s critics noted Pollyanna''s performance was "smart, sassy and sexy in equal parts....the emotional center of the film" praised her capacity to find the "emotional vulnerability" of her seemingly tough and ambitious character.

Her demanding turn as the lead in Lucky McKee''s The Woman (2011) made shock waves at Sundance 2011, brought rave reviews and topped the New York Times readers'' favorite movies poll.

Montagu Love (15 March 1880 – 17 May 1943), also known as Montague Love, was an English screen, stage and vaudeville actor.

Born Harry Montague Love in Portsmouth, Hampshire, he was the son of Harry Love (b. 1852) and Fanny Louisa Love, née Poad (b. 1856); his father was listed as accountant on the 1881 English Census. Educated in Great Britain, Love began his career as an artist and military correspondent with his first important job as a London newspaper cartoonist. Love honed basic stage talents in London, and in 1913 sailed to the Canada and crossed the border into the United States in November with a road-company production of Cyril Maude''s Grumpy.

Usually Love was cast in heartless villain roles. In the 1920s, he played with Rudolph Valentino in The Son of the Sheik, opposite John Barrymore in Don Juan, and appeared with Lillian Gish in 1928''s The Wind. He also portrayed ''Colonel Ibbetson'' in Forever (1921), the silent film version of Peter Ibbetson. Love was one of the more successful villains in silent films.

One of Love''s first sound films was the part-talkie The Mysterious Island co-starring Lionel Barrymore. In 1937, he played Henry VIII in the first talking film version of Mark Twain''s The Prince and the Pauper, with Errol Flynn. Love played the bigoted Bishop of the Black Canons in The Adventures of Robin Hood, starring Flynn, too. However, he also played gruff authoritarian figures, such as Monsieur Cavaignac, who, contrary to history, demands the resignation of those responsible for the Dreyfus coverup, in The Life of Emile Zola (1937), as well as Don Alejandro de la Vega, whose son appears to be a fop but is actually Zorro, in the 1940 version of The Mark of Zorro, starring Tyrone Power.

In 1941, he played a doctor in Shining Victory, which also starred James Stephenson, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Crisp. In 1939''s Gunga Din, it is Montagu Love who reads the final stanza of Rudyard Kipling''s original poem over the body of the slain Din.

Love''s last film to be released, Devotion, was released three years after his death aged 63 in 1943. He was interred at Chapel of the Pines Crematory. His last acting stint was on Wings Over the Pacific (1943).', 'Portsmouth, Hampshire, England, UK', 1, '/xCbs0dRi64AuOggWaTZyE5KQ3T8.jpg'),

Robert Coote (4 February 1909 – 26 November 1982) was an English actor. He played aristocrats or British military types in many films, and created the role of Colonel Hugh Pickering in the long-running original Broadway production of My Fair Lady.

Coote was born in London and educated at Hurstpierpoint College in Sussex. He began his stage career at the age of 16, performing in Britain, South Africa, and Australia before arriving in Hollywood in the late 1930s. He played a succession of pompous British types in supporting roles, including a brief but memorable turn as Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham in Gunga Din (1939). His acting career was interrupted by his service as a squadron leader in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He played Bob Trubshawe in Powell and Pressburger''s A Matter of Life and Death (1946), chosen for the first-ever Royal Film Performance on 1 November 1946, before he returned to Hollywood, where his films included The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), Forever Amber (1947), The Three Musketeers (1948), and Orson Welles'' Othello (1952).

In 1956, Coote created the role of Colonel Pickering in the original Broadway production of My Fair Lady (1956–62), which he reprised in the musical''s 1976–77 Broadway revival. He also originated the role of King Pellinore in the Broadway production of Camelot (1960–63). He was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance as Timmy St. Clair in the NBC TV series The Rogues (1964–65). In 1966, Coote appeared with Jackie Gleason and Art Carney in an episode of The Honeymooners entitled "The Honeymooners in England", broadcast on CBS-TV from Miami.

In his last feature film performance, Coote portrayed one of the critics dispatched by Vincent Price in Theatre of Blood (1973).

His final role was on television, playing orchid nurse Theodore Horstmann in the 1981 NBC-TV series Nero Wolfe, starring William Conrad in the title role. In most film and TV adaptations of Nero Wolfe mysteries, before and since, Horstmann has been a very minor character, but Coote''s Horstmann got considerable screen time in the series.

The veteran British character actor died in his sleep at the New York Athletic Club in November 1982, at the age of 73.

Cady also appeared on some radio programs including Gunsmoke. In the 1950s, Cady played Doc Williams in The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952), along with numerous supporting parts in movies and also appeared in television commercials for (among other products) Shasta Grape Soda.

George Harvey Strait (born May 18, 1952) is an American country music singer, actor and music producer. Strait is referred to as the "King of Country," and critics call Strait a living legend. He is known for his unique style of western swing music, bar-room ballads, honky-tonk style, and fresh yet traditional Country music. George Strait holds the world record for more #1 hit singles than any other artist in the history of music on any chart or in any genre, having recorded 57 #1 hit singles as of 2010.

Strait rocketed to success after his first single "Unwound" was a hit in 1981. While contributing to the neo-traditional movement of the 1980s, he amassed seven number one albums in the decade with his most popular hits including "Fool Hearted Memory" and "Ocean Front Property". By the 1990s, Strait had influenced a new breed of performers while continuing his own successes, having charted upwards of 20 number one hits including "Heartland" and "Blue Clear Sky". The next decade for which he was named Artist Of The Decade by the ACM, he was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame and won his first Grammy award for his hit album Troubadour. Strait continued his previous successes during this time, producing a more contemporary sound with moderate cross-over hits including "She''ll Leave You with a Smile" and "You''ll Be There".

Strait won CMA Entertainer of the year in 1989 and 1990 and ACM Entertainer of the year in 1990. He has been nominated for more CMA and ACM awards and has more wins in both categories than any other artist. As of 2009, he holds the record for the most Number One hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts with 44 number one singles on that chart. Counting all other music charts, Strait has amassed a total of 57 number one hits overall, breaking a record previously set by Conway Twitty.

Strait has sold more than 68.5 million albums in the United States and his certifications from the RIAA include 13 multi-platinum, 33 platinum and 38 gold albums. His best-selling album is Pure Country (1992), which sold 6 million (6× Multi-platinum). His highest certified album is Strait Out of the Box (1995), which sold 2 million copies (8× Multi-Platinum due to being a box set with four CDs). According to the RIAA, Strait is the 12th best-selling recording artist with the albums in the United States overall.

Irving Rapper (16 January 1898, or 1902 – 20 December 1999) was an England-born American film director.

Born to a Jewish family in London, England, Rapper emigrated to the United States and became an actor and stage director on Broadway while studying at New York University. In 1936, he went to Hollywood, where he was hired by Warner Bros. as an assistant director and dialogue coach. He proved invaluable in translating and mediating for non-native English-speaking directors. By the early 1940s, he had metamorphosed into one of the hottest directors on the Warner Bros. lot.

He made his directing debut with the 1941 film Shining Victory, in which his friend Bette Davis appeared as a show of support for him. He would go on to direct her in four more films, Now, Voyager (1942), The Corn Is Green (1945), Deception (1946), and Another Man''s Poison (1952). In later years, Rapper admitted that he found Davis very difficult to work with and that she would, "...hold the whole set hostage, stopping production for a day, because of her mood."

Rapper''s film One Foot in Heaven (1941) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film. Perhaps his best film in a studio other than Warner Bros. was The Brave One (1956) about a Mexican boy who must rescue his bull from a brutal fight against a top matador, which earned the then-blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo an Academy Award for his original screenplay despite being a box office failure.

Additional credits include The Voice of the Turtle (1947), The Glass Menagerie (1950), Marjorie Morningstar (1958), and The Miracle, a 1959 remake of the 1912 hand-colored, black-and-white film The Miracle.

Biopics directed by Rapper include The Adventures of Mark Twain (1944), Rhapsody in Blue (1945), Pontius Pilate (co-director, 1962) and his last film, Born Again (1978), about convicted Watergate conspirator and former Richard Nixon aide Charles Colson.

Eduard Franz (born Eduard Franz Schmidt; October 31, 1902 – February 10, 1987) was an American actor of theatre, film and television. Franz portrayed King Ahab in the 1953 biblical low-budget film Sins of Jezebel, Jethro in Cecil B. DeMille''s The Ten Commandments (1956), and Jehoam in Henry Koster''s The Story of Ruth (1960).  By 1936, Franz was a player on the national stage, performing from coast to coast. He became a leading Broadway actor for nearly 30 years, in such plays as First Stop to Heaven and Embezzled Heaven and Conversation At Midnight. He made his film debut in a bit part, in 1947, in Killer at Large, but followed that brief appearance the next year with a memorable role in the motion picture The Scar (also titled Hollow Triumph). His fourth movie saw him acting with John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch, in 1948. He portrayed Chief Broken Hand in White Feather. He played such intellectuals as Dr. Stern in The Thing from Another World (1951), a university professor in The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake (1959), and Justice Louis Brandeis in The Magnificent Yankee (1950), a role he reprised in the 1965 television adaptation. He appeared in a 1957 television adaptation of A. J. Cronin''s novel Beyond This Place, which was directed by Sidney Lumet.

Franz performed as well in two separate remakes of Al Jolson''s 1927 cinema classic The Jazz Singer, each time playing the key role of the aged and ailing synagogue cantor upset by his son''s decision to pursue a secular show-business career rather than continue the family tradition and follow in his father''s religious footsteps. Those remakes were the 1952 film version of the story starring Danny Thomas and the 1959 television version starring Jerry Lewis.

Franz performed in a number of television series, including Gunsmoke; Have Gun - Will Travel; The Law and Mr. Jones; The Barbara Stanwyck Show and Cimarron City.

Hit Parader Magazine dubbed him "the king of big-screen martial arts villains." From the deadly killer in Red Sun Rising (1994) to the deadly fighter in the comedy spoof Hot Shots 2 (1993), Lew has proven his chops in both drama and comedy.

Sherman specialised almost exclusively in B-westerns,  (including the "Three Mesqueteers" series, which featured a young John Wayne),  with occasional forays into action and horror themes. He often achieved  a sense of style over substance. Indeed, as to his handling of the  ''Mesqueteers'', Variety commented on his imparting a "poetry in motion"  to his "unified timing of cowboys mounting, riding, wheeling, galloping  and dismounting of steeds" (July 2 1939). From 1940, Sherman also served  as associate producer on many of his films.

The diminutive (five  foot) Sherman turned out reliable low-budget fare for Columbia between  1945 and 1948, then moved on to do the same at Universal for another  eight years. Thereafter, he turned to free-lancing and working in  television.

Walter Sande (July 9, 1906 - November 22, 1971) was an American actor, notable for film roles including Paul Revere in Walt Disney''s Johnny Tremain.

Born in Denver, Colorado, he was one of those stern, heavyset character actors in Hollywood no person could recognize by name. He showed an early interest in music as a youth and by his college years managed to start his own band. This led to a job as musical director for 20th Century-Fox''s theater chain, which, in turn, led him to acting in films beginning in 1937. Usually providing atmospheric bits with no billing, he made an initial impression in serial cliffhangers as a third-string heavy with the popular The Green Hornet Strikes Again! and Sky Raiders.

His first top featured role, however, would come with The Iron Claw as Jack "Flash" Strong, a photographer who, uncharacteristically for Walter, served as a comic sidekick to our serial hero. Best of all would be his role in another serial as Red Pennington, the amusing sidekick to Don Winslow of the Navy. He repeated his role again in Don Winslow of the Coast Guard, the successful sequel.

The Pennington role would spark a long and steady career in movies, usually a step or two behind Hollywood''s elite, in To Have and Have Not (prominently featured as the fisherman who tries to cheat Bogie), in Along Came Jones, The Blue Dahlia, Dark City and Bad Day at Black Rock, among hundreds of others. A regular authoritative presence in these classic sci-fi films Red Planet Mars, The War of the Worlds and Invaders from Mars. He also had a recurring featured part in the 1940s Boston Blackie film series playing Detective Matthews alongside ''Chester Morris former thief-turned-crime hero.

A primary support player during the ''golden age'' of TV, Walter worked on nearly every popular western and crime show available throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He had a regular series role on "The Adventures of Tugboat Annie" as Captain Horatio Bullwinkle, Annie''s tugboat rival, and a recurring one as Lars "Papa" Holstrum, on "The Farmer''s Daughter". He died of a heart attack in 1971 at age sixty-five in Chicago, Illinois.

Diane Brewster (11 March 1931 in Kansas City, Missouri – 12 November 1991 in Studio City, California) was an American television actress most noted for playing three distinctively different roles in US TV series of the 1950s and 60s: confidence trickster "Samantha Crawford" in Maverick; pretty young second-grade teacher "Miss Canfield" in Leave It to Beaver; and doomed wife "Helen Kimble" in The Fugitive.

On Maverick, a sophisticated ABC western series featuring James Garner and Jack Kelly, Brewster''s character was a gorgeous gambling con artist who often faked a southern accent. Though she was usually on the wrong side of the law, she was also ultimately likable; perhaps this was because "Samantha Crawford" was named after Maverick writer/producer Roy Huggins'' mother.

Brewster had actually first played Crawford in one 1956 episode of Cheyenne, another western television series (episode entitled "Dark Rider"), before showing up opposite James Garner in the third episode of Maverick, "According to Hoyle." Brewster''s other Maverick appearances include the episodes "The Savage Hills" with Jack Kelly, "The Seventh Hand" with Garner, and the famous "Shady Deal at Sunny Acres" with both Kelly and Garner. Including the Cheyenne episode, Brewster played Samantha Crawford only five times (with her last appearance coming in 1958), but she made an indelible impression on critics and viewers. Jodie Foster''s character in the Mel Gibson movie version was based on Brewster''s Samantha Crawford.

Credited as Diana Brewster in the credits for the pilot episode of Leave It to Beaver.

Brewster portrayed the grade school teacher "Miss Canfield" on Leave It to Beaver for the series'' first season in 1957/58 (a role she also played in the 1980s TV revivals). Brewster appeared in the show''s pilot, "It''s a Small World," as Miss Simms, a secretary with a dairy company, and in four regular season episodes as Miss Canfield. In Episode 1 she appears in the credits as "Diana Brewster", a mistake which was corrected in her next appearance in Episode 8.

Brewster went on to make almost fifty appearances in various other television and film roles, including episodes of Brian Keith'' s Cold War drama, Crusader, and Wendell Corey''s military series, Harbor Command. In 1960, she had a starring role in ABC''s The Islanders, with William Reynolds and James Philbrook. She guest starred in the series premiere in 1964 of Dennis Weaver''s NBC series Kentucky Jones. As a favor to Roy Huggins, Brewster appeared several times with no screen credit as murdered wife Helen Kimble (in flashbacks) in Huggins'' TV series The Fugitive, which ran from 1963-1967.

Brewster died of heart failure at the age of sixty in 1991. She was a direct descendant of Elder William Brewster (pilgrim), (c. 1567 - April 10, 1644), the Pilgrim leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the Mayflower; Martha Wadsworth Brewster (1710 - c. 1757) a notable 18th-century American poet and writer, and Governor William Bradford (1590–1657) of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the Mayflower.

She and Dr. Jabe Walker (oral surgeon) had a son, Dean C., born in Los Angeles March 29, 1960 and a daughter, Lynn D., born in Los Angeles July 25, 1961.

She semi-retired from the business after that to raise her two children. In the 1960-61 TV season, Cristal appeared as a female matador in NBC''s The Tab Hunter Show.

She was coaxed out of retirement when she became the last cast member to be added to the NBC series The High Chaparral. David Dortort had been auditioning actresses for three weeks, seeking just the right woman with good looks, acting ability and a fiery personality, who could breathe life into the aristocratic "Victoria Montoya". He had just about given up hope of ever finding the right actress when Cristal heard about the part. Her agent thought the role had already been cast, but she urged him to check, and he found out that it was still open.

She later appeared in such popular television series as Bonanza, Barnaby Jones and The Love Boat. After that, she took assignments only as the notion struck her favorably, such as the Charles Bronson action film Mr. Majestyk.

He appeared in a number of British films and television series, as aristocrats, including starring roles in the television comedy series The World of Wooster (as "Bingo Little"),[2] and in the comedy film One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing[1] (as "Lord Southmere"), as well as appearing in the James Bond spoof film Casino Royale.[2]

Derek Nimmo made his name as the Reverend Mervyn Noote in the British sitcom All Gas and Gaiters (1966). At the time it was considered rather controversial because the main characters were senior churchmen (the Bishop, his chaplain Noote and the Archdeacon) who got into various scrapes as a result of their general incompetence. By the time the series finished, Nimmo was identified with the stereotype of a traditional British clergyman and he went on to play a bungling monk in another BBC clerical sitcom, Oh, Brother! and its sequel series Oh, Father! (now a Roman Catholic priest).[3] Another sitcom in which he appeared in a starring role as a clergyman, many years later, was Hell''s Bells (by now promoted to a dean).[2] He also appeared as the Reverend Jonathan Green in a television production of Cluedo.

Irving Reis, (born May 7, 1906, in New York City – died July 3, 1953, in Woodland Hills, California) was a radio program producer and director, and a film director.

ving Reis was born into a Jewish family.

Reis began his career as a motion picture photographer. The most notable of his screen efforts was being one of the photographers for The Hollywood Revue of 1929.

A 1931 notice in Variety declared that he was transitioning into a playwright. By 1933, Variety took notice of his radio play St. Louis Blues. His radio play Meridian 7-1212 first broadcast on January 24, 1935, received an "above par" comment from Variety. Observing that he wrote and produced the play, the unnamed reviewer noted the numerous radio effects, and that compared to his two previous radio plays, this was the best.

Reis was the creator of Columbia Workshop, the experimental anthology program on the radio, and its initial broadcast took place on July 18, 1936.

Reis departed for Hollywood on January 1, 1938 where he became a scriptwriter for Paramount Pictures. In November 1939, Variety announced that Reis would be taking 10 weeks off from his script writing at Paramount to study film direction.

In February 1940, Variety announced that Reis had left Paramount to begin directing at RKO Pictures. Among his motion picture credits are Enchantment, Roseanna McCoy, The Big Street, and the screen adaptation of Arthur Miller''s play All My Sons (1948). Reis also directed the movie The Four Poster, based on Jan de Hartog''s play The Fourposter.

Reis married Meta Arenson in Tijuana on August 10, 1938.

Falmouth was a small sleepy town  then, as it is still today. He was one of 12 siblings who were moved to  Lakeland sometime around WW I. Lakeland is where Dan was introduced into  show business in 1922 at the age of 14. He ran away from home when the  show moved on and traveled thousands of miles throughout the South in  tent, minstrel, vaudeville and theater shows. Dan performed on stage  with his brother Willard for nine years with a stock company in Tampa''s  old Rialto Theater. Frances Langford  worked with him during this time and it was Dan who told her to go to  Hollywood. During this period he met Matilda "Tilda" Mae Spivey on the  stage, and married her on February 25, 1933. Tilda had a two-year-old  child from a previous marriage by the name of Arthur "Art" Grant  Gifford. Times were tough, so Dan had to get out of show business for a  while to make some real money. In 1934 he found work with the  Conservation Corps in Homestead, Florida, but show business was always  in his heart. Dan knew he had what it took to "make it" in Hollywood, so  he decided to make the move to California in 1935. They packed all  their possessions into their Ford and started the long, arduous trek  across the country. This was during the Great Depression, and money was  very tight. They had to stop frequently in various cities across the  country to make extra money to continue their journey. Dan was a very  good auto mechanic and never had a problem finding this type of work  wherever he went. This skill paid off once during the filming of To Kill a Mockingbird  (1962). During the "mob" scene, one of the cars they were to drive away  in would not start. Dan opened the hood, stepped onto the front bumper,  and had the car running in no time flat.

Ahn''s first film was A Scream in the Night in 1935.

His first credited roles came in 1936 in The General Died at Dawn and Stowaway, opposite Shirley Temple. He starred opposite Anna May Wong in Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1937).

During World War II, Ahn often played Japanese villains in war films. Mistakenly thought to be Japanese, he received several death threats.

Selena Royle (November 6, 1904 – April 23, 1983) was an American actress (of stage, radio, television and film), and later, an author.  Royle was born in New York City to playwright Edwin Milton Royle and actress Selena Fetter (April 12, 1860 - May 10, 1955). She had an older sister, Josephine Fetter Royle (1901–1992).

Her mother recounted in a newspaper article that she used to take Selena along with her to her rehearsals and performances. One night, then seven-year-old Selena went missing. While the mother frantically searched for her, holding up act two, the audience became restless. The youngster finally turned up - she had gone on stage dressed in her mother''s second-act costume; she made a bow, much to the audience''s amusement. She later remarked, "And that is the first time I was ever on stage, and I liked it so well I stayed."

Her father wrote the 1921 Broadway play Lancelot and Elaine to provide both her and sister Josephine with their first professional roles, as Guinevere and Elaine respectively. Eventually, she landed a part on her own in the 1923 Theatre Guild production of Peer Gynt, with Joseph Schildkraut, and became a respected Broadway actress. She made one film in the 1930s, Misleading Lady, but otherwise worked on the stage and on radio.

Royle began her radio career in 1926 or 1927 and performed "almost continuously since", according to a 1939 newspaper item.

Her body of work includes playing the title role in Hilda Hope, M.D. She also played Martha Jackson in Woman of Courage, Mrs. Allen in Against the Storm, Joan in The O''Neills, and Mrs. Gardner in Betty and Bob, and appeared in Kate Hopkins.

In the 1940s, she returned to film and had a successful run, mainly playing maternal characters such as the bereaved mother of The Fighting Sullivans (1944), mother to Jane Powell in the big screen adaptation of A Date with Judy (1948) and the title character''s mother opposite Ingrid Bergman as Joan of Arc (1948).

She made several appearances on early television. However, in 1951, when she refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. She sued the American Legion, which had published Red Channels, in which her name was listed, and won but her acting career ended. She made only three more roles, the last being Murder Is My Beat (1955).

She also wrote several books, including Guadalajara: as I Know It, Live It, Love It (which went through several editions) and a couple of cookbooks, and some magazine articles.

He was nicknamed "Big Boy" as he was 6'' 2" and had a muscular build from years of working on ranches and playing semi-pro and professional baseball.

Williams made his screen debut in the 1919 comedy, Almost A Husband, with Will Rogers and Cullen Landis, and was featured in a large supporting role ten years later in Frank Borzage''s Lucky Star with Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. Throughout the 1920s Williams would have a string of successful films, mostly westerns.

He then appeared in The Great Meadow alongside Johnny Mack Brown, which was Brown''s breakout film. Throughout the 1930s, Williams acted in supporting roles, mostly in westerns, sports, or outdoor dramas. Although not the lead actor in any of them, he was always employed, and was successful as a supporting actor. He often played alongside Hoot Gibson and Harry Carey during that period. In 1941, he became one of many actors cast by Universal Pictures in their large film series, Riders of Death Valley. From the late 1930s to the mid-1940s, Williams appeared in supporting roles in a number of A-pictures, sometimes with high billing, such as You Only Live Once, and in Columbia''s first Technicolour film The Desperadoes (1943).

Williams was frequently teamed with Alan Hale, Sr. as sidekicks to Errol Flynn in several of his pictures.

Barbara Pepper (born Marion B. Pepper; May 31, 1915 – July 18, 1969) was an American stage, television, radio, and film actress. She is best known as the first "Doris Ziffel" on the sitcom Green Acres.  Pepper was born in New York City, the daughter of actor David Mitchell "Dave" Pepper, and his wife, Harrietta S. Pepper. At age 16 she started life in show business with Goldwyn Girls, a musical stock company where she met lifelong friend Lucille Ball.

Pepper began making movies. Among her later film parts were small roles in My Fair Lady and It''s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. She also performed radio parts. In 1943, she married actor Craig Reynolds (né Harold Hugh Enfield), and the couple later had two sons. After Reynolds died in 1949 in a California motorcycle accident, Pepper was left to raise their children alone. She never remarried.

After gaining weight, her roles were mostly confined to small character parts on television, including several appearances on I Love Lucy, The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Petticoat Junction, and The Jack Benny Program. She made four appearances on Perry Mason, including the role of Martha Dale, mother of the title character, in the 1957 episode "The Case of the Vagabond Vixen".

A long-time friend of Lucille Ball, Barbara was considered for the role of Ethel Mertz on "I Love Lucy," but was passed over due to the fact that she was reportedly a drinker. William Frawley ("Fred Mertz") was, likewise, reportedly, a drinker and was already cast. It was felt that having two drinkers in the cast might eventually cause difficulties so they auditioned and found Vivian Vance to play Ethel instead.

She may be best remembered as the first Doris Ziffel on Petticoat Junction in 1964, although her character''s name on the "Genghis Keane" episode of Petticoat Junction was Ruth Ziffel. Her role as Doris Ziffel continued on Green Acres from 1965 to 1968, until heart ailments finally forced her to leave that weekly series. Veteran actress Fran Ryan replaced her on Green Acres, which would continue to run for another three years. Her final performance was in the 1969 film Hook, Line & Sinker, in which she played Jerry Lewis''s secretary.', 'New York City, New York, USA', 1, '/7W0qmTcZpGh8A5wGzL2zOOl7qCu.jpg'),

He was born in Norbiton, Surrey, lived in Sweden, Canada and Lithuania for many years, and now lives in France. He is one of the pioneers of docudrama. His movies, pacifist and radical, strongly review the limit of classic documentary and movies. He mainly concentrates his works and ideas around the mass media and our relation/participation to a movie or television documentary.

Nearly all of Watkins'' films have used a combination of dramatic and documentary elements to dissect historical occurrences or possible near future events. The first of these, Culloden, portrayed the Jacobite uprising of 1745 in a documentary style, as if television reporters were interviewing the participants and accompanying them into battle; a similar device was used in his biographical film Edvard Munch. La Commune (Paris, 1871) reenacts the Paris Commune days using a large cast of French non-actors.

In 2004 he also wrote a book, Media Crisis, an engaged essay about the media crisis, the monoform and, foremost, the lack of debate around the construction of new forms of audiovisual media.

She made her acting debut when just six months old, when director James Cruze saw her in her baby carriage and immediately cast her as the baby in his film Mannequin (1926). Her first major role was in Night Nurse (1931), in which she played a sick child that a sinister hospital staff was trying to murder. By age 10, Marcia Mae had appeared in several dramatic films.

Aline Kominsky-Crumb (born Aline Goldsmith, August 1948, Long Beach, New York) is an American underground comics artist best known as the wife of cartoonist R. Crumb.

She was born to a middle class Jewish family in the Five Towns area of Long Island. Her father was a largely unsuccessful businessman and organized crime associate. She later claimed that the social milieu shown in the movie Goodfellas (some of which was set in the Five Towns area) bore some resemblance to her own childhood. As a teenager, she turned towards drugs and the counterculture, and was a hanger-on to New York countercultural musicians such as The Fugs. Relocating to East Village during her college years, she began studying art at The Cooper Union.

In 1968, she married her first husband, Carl Kominsky, with whom she relocated to Tucson, Arizona. Their marriage did not last long. However, she retained the surname Kominsky after their split. During this time, she attended University of Arizona, graduating with a BFA in 1971. She was also introduced to Spain Rodriguez and Kim Deitch by former Fugs drummer Ken Weaver, who was living in Tucson at the time. Spain and Deitch introduced her to underground comics, inspiring her to begin writing underground comics herself and to relocate to San Francisco.

Soon after arriving in San Francisco, she was introduced to Robert Crumb by mutual friends, who noted an uncanny resemblance between her and the coincidentally-named Crumb character Honeybunch Kaminski. Their relationship soon became serious and they began living together not long after. She also fell in with the Wimmen''s Comix collective, and contributed to the first issue of that series. After she and Diane Noomin had a falling out with Trina Robbins and other members of the collective, they started their own title, Twisted Sisters. Kominsky-Crumb has later claimed that a large part of her break with the Wimmen''s Comix group was over feminist issues and particularly over her relationship with Robert Crumb, whom Robbins particularly disliked.

Aline married Robert Crumb in 1978. Their daughter Sophie Crumb was born in 1981. Since the late 1970s, she and Robert have produced a series of collaborative comics called Dirty Laundry (also known as Aline &amp; Bob''s Dirty Laundry), a comic about the Crumb family life. Each of them drew his or her own characters for the comic. Later installments of Dirty Laundry feature contributions by Sophie, who also began producing comics in her teens.

For several years during the 1980s, she was editor of Weirdo, a leading alternative comics anthology of the time, taking over editorship from Peter Bagge, who had taken over from original editor Robert Crumb.

She was featured in a number of scenes in Crumb, the 1994 documentary about the Crumb family. Since the early 1990s, she and Robert have lived as expatriates in a small village in Languedoc-Roussillon.

In addition to her comics work, Kominsky-Crumb is also a painter and since moving to France, has focused more on painting and less on producing comics.

Robert Kenner is an American film and television screenwriter, television director, film director, film producer, and television producer.

His career began in 1971 as an assistant cinematographer, and produced his first motion picture, 3:15 - The Moment of Truth, in 1984 (although it was not released until 1986). His second feature film did not come until 1991''s Lonely Hearts.

His first breakout project was the televised documentary The Lost Fleet of Guadalcanal, which he produced for the National Geographic Society and which aired in 1993 on PBS. The following year, he directed and produced Russia''s Last Tsar for National Geographic and PBS. He also directed and produced America''s Endangered Species: Don''t Say Good-bye in 1996. The International Documentary Association presented the picture with the Strand Award for Best Documentary.

Kenner began a long association with the award-winning PBS documentary television program American Experience in 1998. That year he directed and produced the widely reviewed Influenza, 1918 (about the 1918 flu pandemic)and followed it up with John Brown''s Holy War (about abolitionist John Brown) in 2001. His first documentary which he wrote, directed and produced was War Letters, which aired on American Experience in 2001. The documentary is based on the 2001 New York Times best-selling book War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars by historian Andrew Carroll. He produced the episode, "The Road to Memphis," for the 2003 PBS documentary series, The Blues, and in 2005 produced and directed the Vietnam War documentary, Two Days in October. The documentary was the season premiere of American Experience. The film, which is based on David Maraniss'' book They Marched into Sunlight, looks at the parallels between a Viet Cong ambush of a U.S. Army patrol (and the subsequent cover-up of the loss by the American military) and a violent clash between police and student protesters at the University of Wisconsin–Madison—events which occurred 24 hours apart in October 1967. The episode was nominated for and won the award for Exceptional Merit in Nonfiction Filmmaking at the 2006 Emmy Awards.

In 2008, Kenner produced and directed the documentary film, Food, Inc., which examines large-scale agricultural food production in the United States, concluding that the meat and vegetables produced by this type of economic enterprise leads to inexpensive but environmentally harmful and unhealthy food.

Bruno Dumont (born 1958, Bailleul, France) is a French film director. To date, he has directed five feature films, all of which border somewhere between realistic drama and the avant-garde. His films have won several awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Two of Dumont''s films have won the Grand Prix award: both L''Humanité (1999) and Flandres (2006). Dumont''s Hadewijch won the 2009 Prize of the International Critics (FIPRESCI Prize) for Special Presentation at the Toronto Film Festival, and will be distributed in France in 2009, and by IFC in the U.S. in 2010.

Dumont has a background of Greek and German (Western) philosophy, and of corporate video. His films often show the ugliness of extreme violence and provocative sexual behavior, and are usually classified as art films. Dumont has himself likened his films to visual arts, and he typically uses long takes, close-ups of people''s bodies, and story lines involving extreme emotions. Dumont does not write traditional scripts for his films. Instead, he writes complete novels which are then the basis for his filmmaking.

He says that some of his favorite filmmakers are Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Roberto Rossellini, and Abbas Kiarostami. He is frequently considered an artistic heir to Robert Bresson.

His work has been associated with the New French Extremity. His film Outside Satan premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

Dolores Moran (January 27, 1924 – February 5, 1982) was an American film actress and model.

Moran''s brief career as a film actress began in 1942 with some uncredited roles in such films as Yankee Doodle Dandy. By 1943 she had become a popular pin-up girl and appeared on the cover of such magazines as Yank. She was given supporting roles in films such as Old Acquaintance (1943) with Bette Davis and Warner Bros. attempted to increase interest in her, promoting her along with Lauren Bacall as a new screen personality when they co-starred with Humphrey Bogart in To Have and Have Not (1944). The film made a star of Bacall, but Moran languished and her subsequent films did little to further her career, this probably had something to do with Howard Hawk''s decision to marginalise Moran in order to boost the screen presence of Bacall, excising some of Moran''s scenes.

The Horn Blows at Midnight gave her a leading role with Jack Benny and Alexis Smith but her film appearances after this were sporadic, and she suffered ill health that reduced her ability to work. Her film career ended in 1954 with a featured role in the John Payne and Lizabeth Scott western film Silver Lode.

She was married to the film producer Benedict E. Bogeaus in Salome, Arizona, in 1946. Their son, Brett Benedict, born August 30, 1948, in Hollywood, later became a successful businessman. They divorced in 1962, he died of a heart attack in 1968. Moran had an affair with director Howard Hawks while filming To Have and Have Not, which Hawks undertook mainly as revenge for his rejection by Bacall in favour of Bogart.

In 1982, Dolores Moran died of cancer. She was survived by her son, sister, and mother.

Paul Cavanagh (8 December 1888 – 15 March 1964) was an English film actor. He appeared in more than 100 films between 1928 and 1959.

Cavanagh was born in Chislehurst, Kent, and attended the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Cavanagh studied law in England, earning a master of arts degree at Cambridge. A newspaper article published 17 June 1931, reported, "It is on record that Cavanagh won high honors in mathematics and history."

Cavanagh practised "for several years" before he changed professions. He went to Canada "for a year of sightseeing and wandering" before he joined the Royal Northwest Mounted Police.

After serving in World War I, he returned to Canada, where he practised law, including revising the statutes of Alberta, but eventually went back to England to practise law.

Cavanagh went onto the stage after a stroke of bad luck in 1924 caused him to lose his savings, and later he went into films.

In 1926, Cavanagh lost $22,000 in one evening on a roulette wheel in Monte Carlo. An observer offered to provide a letter "to some of my theatrical acquaintances" in London, England. Those contacts led to Cavanagh''s role in It Pays to Advertise.

Cavanagh first film contract and film came in 1929 with Paramount Pictures.

Cavanagh died In London from a heart attack in 1964, aged 75.', 'Chislehurst, Kent [now in Bromley, London], England, UK', 1, '/jg2lKaQ8DhSmO6ejmQq1TKLSQ1n.jpg'),

Nicole Jaffe (born 1946) is an American actress and voice actress, best known as the original voice of Velma Dinkley in Hanna-Barbera''s Scooby-Doo Saturday morning cartoon series from 1969 to 1974. Before Scooby-Doo began production, Jaffe had appeared in The Trouble with Girls with Elvis Presley (and future Scooby-Doo co-star Frank Welker) and in Disney''s The Love Bug.

Velma was Jaffe''s only voice role. Like her character, Jaffe was myopic and needed glasses or contacts to see. At the first voice recording rehearsal for Scooby-Doo, Where are You!, Jaffe accidentally dropped her glasses and cried out something to the effect of "my glasses! I can''t see without them," which became a trademark gag and catch phrase for Velma.

Jaffe retired from acting after getting married to Brad David in 1973 and getting a job as an agent for the William Morris Agency. She briefly returned to the series 30 years later for the 2003 direct-to-video movies Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire and Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico.

Rex Lloyd Lease (February 11, 1903 – January 3, 1966) was an American actor. He appeared in over 300 films, mainly in westerns.

Lease arrived in Hollywood in 1924. He found bit and supporting parts at Film Booking Office (FBO), Rayart, more, and was given the opportunity to play a few leads. His first film was A Woman Who Sinned (1924).

Rex''s earliest westerns were a pair of Tim McCoy silents at MGM, one of which was The Law of the Range (1928) which had a very young Joan Crawford as the heroine and Rex as the "Solitaire Kid". Tim and Lease became friends, and over the next dozen or so years he appeared in seven more McCoy westerns.

He had a featured role in director Frank Capra''s The Younger Generation (1929), a tale of a Jewish family that move to a more upscale neighborhood.

He successfully made the transition to talkies, and starred in melodramas, action flicks, old dark house mysteries, and comedies as well as a couple of western serials and about a dozen low-budget sagebrush yarns and outdoor adventures.

In between lead roles, Lease did featured parts in some B westerns. He was Hoot Gibson''s brother in Cavalcade of the West (1936); Rex played the "Pecos Kid" in McCoy''s Lightnin'' Bill Carson (1936); and he worked in a couple of Tom Tylers, Ridin'' On (1936) and Fast Bullets (1936). Rex''s finale as a star had him teaming up with Rin-Tin-Tin Jr. in The Silver Trail (1937).

Though no longer afforded star billing, he continued in smaller roles into the 1950s in films and on TV.', 'Central City [now part of Huntington], West Virginia, USA', 1, '/dstgv2uzv4FeuJQa05sJYLmV9rM.jpg'),

As a Columbia contract player she appeared in the studio''s shorts and serials, including Flying G-Men (starring Robert Paige), Pest from the West (starring Buster Keaton), and You Nazty Spy! (starring The Three Stooges). When her Columbia contract lapsed, she found work at Monogram Pictures, where she worked with action star Frankie Darro.

Gray also starred opposite John Wayne in Red River Range (1938) and appeared in the title role in O, My Darling Clementine (1943), a country music film starring Roy Acuff as a singing sheriff.

In her Paramount films, such as Hold ''Em Navy, she was credited as Virginia Pound, but she was given the name Lorna Gray by Columbia and she used it from 1938 until 1945, when she left Columbia and moved to Republic Pictures. She appeared as Lorna Gray in Republic''s Federal Operator 99, but subsequently adopted the name Adrian Booth.

At Republic, she often received co-star billing in Westerns, the only woman other than Dale Evans to be billed so highly at that studio.

James Ellison (May 4, 1910 - December 23, 1993) was an actor, born James Ellison Smith in Guthrie Center, Iowa, son of Edward James Smith and Ona Mary Ellis.

Ellison appeared in nearly seventy films between 1932 and 1962.

Ellison worked for a time in a film laboratory and while there was offered a screen test. He developed it himself and when he saw it, decided it was not satisfactory so he would not show it to the director. But he saw it anyway and Ellison got a contract.

Despite his rugged good looks and height of 6 feet 3 inches, Ellison''s limited range and somewhat wooden screen presence kept him from the first (or even second) ranks of stardom. He spent much of his career in Westerns, including a stint in the mid-thirties as the sidekick of Hopalong Cassidy in Paramount''s successful series. In 1938, he played a charming, romantic character opposite 26 year old Lucille Ball in the comedy, "Next Time I Marry", a film where Ball had her first top billing on screen credits. Before that, in 1936, he played his highest-profile role, as Buffalo Bill in Cecil B. DeMille''s The Plainsman, which also starred Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur.

Despite that film''s success, Ellison spent most of the remainder of his career shuttling between cowboy pictures and more varied roles, primarily in B movies with titles like Mr. District Attorney in the Carter Case and The Undying Monster. He had a supporting role in 1941''s Charley''s Aunt (which starred Jack Benny) and played the romantic lead in 1943''s The Gang''s All Here, a Twentieth Century Fox musical in which he seemed somewhat lost among the vivid antics of Carmen Miranda, Charlotte Greenwood, and Edward Everett Horton (and was the only principal not to sing a note). He also co-starred with Tom Conway and Frances Dee in Val Lewton''s production of I Walked with a Zombie, directed by Jacques Tourneur.

Ellison landed another romantic lead role as ''Jerry Gibson'' in the musical film Lady, Let''s Dance (1944) which starred ice skating sensation ''Belita''.

In the early 1950s, Ellison moved from acting to real estate. Joining fellow veteran Jackie Coogan, Ellison returned to the screen only once to play Axel ''Longhorn'' Gates in a picture called When the Girls Take Over (1962).

James Ellison died at age 83 in Monterey, California after suffering a broken neck as the result of a fall.

Theresa Harris (December 31, 1906 [some sources indicate 1909] – October 8, 1985) was an American film and television actress, singer and dancer.

In 1929 Harris traveled to Hollywood, where she embarked on an acting career. She made her film debut in Thunderbolt, singing the song "Daddy Won''t You Please Come Home". As she entered the 1930s she found herself playing maids to fictitious Southern belles, socialites and female molls. These parts were sometimes uncredited. She also floated around studios doing bit parts, usually at Warner Bros. or MGM. Aside from maids, she specialized in playing blues singers, waitresses, tribal women, prostitutes, and hatcheck girls.

Harris had a featured role as a friend of Jean Harlow in MGM''s Hold Your Man (1932). In 1933 she appeared as Chico in the Warner Bros. pre-Code production of Baby Face, starring Barbara Stanwyck. That same year Harris starred in a substantial role opposite Ginger Rogers in Professional Sweetheart. As Rogers'' character''s maid, Harris'' character subs for Rogers'' character as a singer on the radio. Despite the fact that Harris'' character was a major point for the story''s plot development, she was uncredited for the role.

Throughout the 1930s, Harris played many uncredited parts in films such as Horse Feathers (1932), Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), Mary Stevens, M.D. (1933) and Morning Glory (1933). She also played Bette Davis''s maid Zette in the film Jezebel (1938). In 1937 she appeared in the race film Bargain With Bullets opposite Ralph Cooper for Million Dollar Productions. While doing promotion for the film, Harris spoke about her frustration over the difficulty African American actors faced in the film industry, stating, "I never had the chance to rise about the role of maid in Hollywood movies. My color was against me anyway you looked at it. The fact that I was not "hot" stamped me either as uppity or relegated me to the eternal role of stooge or servant....My ambition is to be an actress. Hollywood had no parts for me."

Harris continued to lobby for better parts but found few opportunities within Hollywood. In the 1939 movie Tell No Tales she was credited for her part as Ruby, the wife of a murdered man. Harris played an emotional scene with Melvin Douglas at the funeral. She appears in a small but vivid role as Kathie Moffat''s ex-maid Eunice Leonard in Jacques Tourneur 1947 Out of the Past.

In addition to films, Harris performed in many radio programs. She was often paired with Eddie Rochester Anderson, who portrayed her on-screen boyfriend. She also appeared in several prominent roles for RKO Pictures as she was a favorite of RKO producer Val Lewton who routinely cast African American actors in non-stereotypical roles. In 1942 Lewton cast Harris as a sarcastic waitress in Cat People, followed by roles in I Walked with a Zombie (1943), Phantom Lady (1944), and Strange Illusion (1945).

During the 1950s Harris appeared several times on television shows. She made her last film appearance in an uncredited role in The Gift of Love in 1958.

Harris later married a doctor and retired from acting, living comfortably after having carefully invested the money she made during her career in the movies.

On October 8, 1985, Harris (then known as Theresa Robinson) died in Inglewood, California.', 'Houston, Texas, USA', 1, '/4WQcTE5lAhlq7uS04CDQ2l43scg.jpg'),

Born in Brooklyn, New York as the eldest child of American stevedore George E. Hall and his English wife Constance L. Fletcher, Ben Hall began making appearances in films when he was little more than ten years old. After a handful of movies, his family moved to Weehawken, New Jersey, and in 1918 Ben took work as a bank clerk in Manhattan. But by 1920, Ben and his mother had moved to Los Angeles (where they were joined later by his younger brother George Jr.).

Hall worked as a property man for the studios for a time, but eventually began to get small roles and was eking out a living as an actor again by 1926. He became a minor but fairly frequently-used member of the John Ford Stock Company, and did eight films for John Ford between 1929 and 1946. Most memorable among these bit roles was probably that of the barber who slicks down and perfumes Wyatt Earp''s hair in My Darling Clementine (1946).

Hall left acting in 1949, though he lived for another 36 years. He died in North Hollywood, California in 1985.

    The Sleeping Cardinal (1931) (US title: Sherlock Holmes'' Fatal Hour) based on Doyle''s two stories, "The Adventure of the Empty House" and "The Final Problem"

    The Missing Rembrandt (1932) (still considered lost) based on "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"

    The Sign of Four: Sherlock Holmes'' Greatest Case (1932)

    The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes (1935) based on The Valley of Fear

    Silver Blaze (1937) (US title:Murder at the Baskervilles, release 1941) based on "Silver Blaze"

Reportedly, Wontner landed the role of Sherlock Holmes thanks to his performance of Holmes imitation Sexton Blake in a 1930 stage production.

Of all Wontner''s films as Sherlock Holmes, The Missing Rembrandt is no longer available. It is officially a lost film. It is possible to obtain all of the others.

Silver Blaze was renamed Murder at the Baskervilles on its US release in order to make the most of the publicity which had been generated by Basil Rathbone''s version of The Hound of the Baskervilles. In many respects Wontner''s film can be seen as a sequel as it is set twenty years after the events of the more famous story.

Wontner''s son became the well-known hotelier and Lord Mayor of London Sir Hugh Wontner.

Since completing his first film in 1985, Maddin has become one of Canada''s most well-known and celebrated film-makers.

Maddin has directed eleven feature films and numerous short films, in addition to publishing three books and creating a host of installation art projects. A number of Maddin''s recent films began as or developed from installation art projects, and his books also relate to his film work. Maddin has been the subject of much critical praise and academic attention, including two books of interviews with Maddin and two book-length academic studies of his work. Maddin was appointed to the Order of Canada, the country''s highest civilian honour, in 2012.[2]

Lyle S. Bettger (February 13, 1915 – September 24, 2003) was a character actor known most for his Hollywood roles from the 1950s, typically portraying villains. He is perhaps most recognisable as the wrathfully jealous elephant handler Klaus from the Oscar winning film The Greatest Show on Earth (1952).

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lyle was the son of Frank Bettger, who was an infielder for the St Louis Cardinals. An enthusiastic fan of cinema, Lyle left school in his late teens with the ambition of becoming an actor.

Bettger graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. His theatrical debut was in Brother Rat at the Biltmore Theatre in New York City in 1936. After a period languishing in small-time theatre he landed the lead role in the Broadway production of The Flying Gerardos in 1940. When Paramount sent a talent scout to see the show, Bettger was signed on a three-year contract.

Bettger''s movie career began when he was cast as the lead in the film noir No Man of Her Own (1950). He soon became a regular on the set of Westerns such as Denver and Rio Grande (1952), The Great Sioux Uprising (1953), Drums Across the River (1954), The Lone Ranger (1956) and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). Lyle developed a reputation for playing the bad guy and excelled in villainous roles such as the menacing Joe Beacom in Union Station (1950) and the cold-blooded Nazi Chief Officer Kirchner in The Sea Chase (1955).

Bettger also made many appearances in dramatic roles on television, starring in the 1957 series The Court of Last Resort as well as guesting on Hawaii Five-O, Rawhide, The Rifleman, Bonanza and The Time Tunnel.

Lyle was married to Mary Rolfe (1940–1996) until her death. They had three children: Lyle Jr., Frank and Paula. He was also survived by a sister, Lee Morgan.

Lyle Bettger died on September 24, 2003 in San Luis Obispo County, California.

Tara Buckman (born October 1, 1956) is an American television and film actress. Her active career was mainly confined to the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. Though never reaching feature status, Buckman was nonetheless a regular guest star on many television series. She also appeared in minor roles in feature films.

Television

Buckman is remembered mostly for her guest appearances in episodes of such 1970s and 1980s television fare as The Rockford Files, Kojak, CHiPs, The Hardy Boys Mysteries, Quincy, M.E., The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo (in which she held a recurring if minor role as Sgt. Brandy Cummings), The Master and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. She also portrayed Norma Kirkland on the daytime drama Days of our Lives in 1984/1985.

In film

Often cast in minor roles in larger budget films, Tara appeared in the Burt Reynolds vehicles Hooper and The Cannonball Run in 1978 and 1981, respectively. Buckman was generally offered the portrayal of largely dimensionless and ''decorative'' parts, such as "Jill - Lamborghini Girl #2" (alongside Adrienne Barbeau) in The Cannonball Run.

Buckman also appeared in several ''B'' movies from the late 1970s through to the mid-1990s. Tara appeared in a rape/murder scene, in which her top was torn open and her throat was slit by a man dressed as Santa Claus in the 1984 controversial horror film Silent Night, Deadly Night. Tara appeared in the 1986 film Never Too Young to Die, her most recent major role was as Dr. Julie Casserly in Xtro 2 (1991).

Donald Cook (September 26, 1901 – October 1, 1961) was an American stage and film actor.

Born in Portland, Oregon, he originally studied farming but later started business with a lumber company. He joined the Kansas Community Players and through this received an offer of stage work. He started screen work in "shorts" before going on to films.

Cook was known for his portrayal of Mike Powers in the film The Public Enemy. He also was one of the first film actors to portray Ellery Queen, in The Spanish Cape Mystery. He played opposite Helen Morgan in the 1936 film adaptation of Show Boat was one of the suspects in the Philo Vance mystery The Casino Murder Case, starred as an heroic immigration inspector in Ellis Island. Other film credits include The Man Who Played God, Our Very Own and The Penguin Pool Murder (1932).

Cook made his Broadway debut in 1926 as Donn Cook, and his New York theatrical career continued until 1959. His credits included a 1948 revival of Private Lives.

Cook was married to Princess Gioia Tasca di Cuto from 1937 until his death from a heart attack in New Haven.

Maurice  Barrymore had emigrated from England in 1875, and after graduating from  Cambridge in law had shocked his family by becoming an actor. Georgiana  Drew of Philadelphia acted in her parents'' stage company. The two met  and married as members of Augustin Daly''s  company in New York. They both acted with some of the great stage  personalities of the mid Victorian theater of America and England. The  Barrymore children were born and grew up in Philadelphia. Though older  brother Lionel Barrymore  began acting early with his mother''s relatives in the Drew theater  company, Ethel, after a traditional girl''s schooling, planned on  becoming a concert pianist.

The lure of the stage was perhaps  congenital, however. She made her debut as a stage actress during the  New York City season of 1894. Her youthful stage presence was at once a  pleasure, a strikingly pretty and winsome face and large dark eyes that  seemed to look out from her very soul. Her natural talent and  distinctive voice only reinforced the physical presence of someone  destined to command any role set before her. After the opportunity to  appear on the London stage with English great Henry Irving in "The  Bells" (1897) and later in "Peter the Great" (1898), she returned to New  York to star in the Clyde Fitch play "Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines" (1901) (produced by her friend and benefactor Charles Frohman), which brought her initial American acclaim. Lead roles, such as Nora in Henrik Ibsen''s  "A Doll''s House" (1905) and starring in "Alice By the Fire" (also  1905), "Mid-Channel" (1910) and "Trelawney of the Wells" (1911) proved  her popularity as a warm and charismatic star of American stage. In the  meantime she married stockbroker Russell Griswold Colt in 1909 and gave  birth to three children while continuing her acting career.

Although  the stage was her first love, she did heed the call of the silver  screen, and though not achieving the matinée idol image that younger  brother John Barrymore garnered in silent movies after similar chemistry on stage, she won over audiences from her first film appearance in The Nightingale  (1914). However, her early film roles, steady through 1919, took a back  seat to continued stage triumphs: "Declassee" (1919), her impassioned  Juliet in "Romeo and Juliet" (1922), "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray" (1924)  and, especially, "The Constant Wife" (1926).

She harnessed her  considerable talents in the role of an activist as well, being a bedrock  supporter of the Actors Equity Association and, in fact, had been a  prominent figure in the actors strike of 1919. By 1930 she was entering  middle age and her movie roles reflected this. Except for Rasputin and the Empress  (1932) with her brothers, the roles were elderly mothers and  grandmothers, dowager ladies and spinster aunts. Perhaps wisely she put  off Hollywood for over a decade, with stage work that included her most  endearing role in "The Corn is Green" (a tour that lasted from 1940 to  1942). She finally moved to Southern California in 1940.

John Gordon Sinclair (born 1962, Glasgow) is a Scottish actor most famous for playing Gregory in Gregory''s Girl. He was born as Gordon John but took the stage name ''John Gordon Sinclair'' because Equity already had a Gordon John registered.

He joined Glasgow''s Youth Theatre after he visited one night and met fellow fan of Canadian progressive rock group Rush, Robert Buchanan. As a result he starred in a number of films by director Bill Forsyth, perhaps the most famous of which was 1981''s Gregory''s Girl, shot when he was 19 years old. He reprised the role nearly two decades later in Gregory''s Two Girls, and also appeared in Forsyth''s Local Hero.

He has continued to act on stage and screen. Other roles include parts in Goodbye Mr Steadman, Mad About Alice Gasping and Roman Road. He was also in the first series of LWT''s Hot Metal and both the radio and television sitcom An Actor''s Life For Me. He played Dan Weir in Espedair Street, the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of the Iain Banks novel, as well as playing the lead part of Dr. Finlay in the Radio 4 series entitled Adventures of a Black Bag.

He appeared in the 1982 Scottish squad''s World Cup song "We Have a Dream", a number 5 hit in the UK, which was written and performed by BA Robertson. It featured John Gordon Sinclair speaking his recollection of a dream about Scottish football success. He later revived this Scottish footballing connection by narrating the 2006-07 BBC Scotland documentary series That Was The Team That Was.

John Gordon Sinclair played Frank McClusky, a leading character, in the 1990 John Byrne TV serial "Your Cheatin'' Heart". He also appeared in "Local Hero". Sinclair played one of the main characters in the Tesco TV adverts in the late 1990s and early 2000s alongside Prunella Scales and Jane Horrocks. He most recently appeared in the West End in The Producers playing the part of Leo Bloom alongside Fred Applegate.

He voiced all the male characters (except for Finbar) in HIT Entertainment''s Rubbadubbers. He was awarded the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award in 1995 for Best Actor in a Musical for his 1994 performance in "She Loves Me".

Thelma Alice Todd (July 29, 1906 – December 16, 1935) was an American actress. Appearing in about 120 pictures between 1926 and 1935, she is best remembered for her comedic roles in films such as Marx Brothers'' Monkey Business and Horse Feathers, a number of Charley Chase''s short comedies, and co-starring with Buster Keaton and Jimmy Durante in Speak Easily. She also had roles in Wheeler and Woolsey farces, several Laurel and Hardy films, the last of which (The Bohemian Girl) featured her in a part that was truncated by her suspicious death at the age of 29.

During the silent film era, Todd appeared in numerous supporting roles that made full use of her beauty but gave her little chance to act. With the advent of the talkies, Todd was given opportunity to expand her roles when producer Hal Roach signed her to appear with such comedy stars as Harry Langdon, Charley Chase, and Laurel and Hardy.

In 1931, Roach cast Todd in her own series of slapstick comedy shorts, running 17 to 27 minutes each. In an attempt to create a female version of Laurel and Hardy, Roach teamed Todd with ZaSu Pitts for 17 shorts, from "Let''s do Things" (June 1931) through "One Track Minds" (May 1933). When Pitts left in 1933, she was replaced by Patsy Kelly, appearing with Todd in 21 shorts, from "Beauty and the Bus" (September 1933) through "An All American Toothache" (January 1936). These Roach shorts often cast Todd as a working girl having all sorts of problems, and trying her best to remain poised and charming despite the embarrassing antics of her sidekick.

Todd also appeared successfully in such dramas as the original 1931 film version of The Maltese Falcon starring Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade, in which she played Miles Archer''s treacherous widow. During her career she appeared in 119 films although many of these were short films, and was sometimes publicized as "The Ice Cream Blonde."

Todd continued her short-subject series through 1935, and was featured in the full-length Laurel and Hardy comedy The Bohemian Girl. This was her last film; she died after completing all of her scenes, but most of them were re-shot. Producer Roach deleted all of Todd''s dialogue and limited her appearance to one musical number.', 'Lawrence, Massachusetts, USA', 1, '/5t8g8JZkstv3nfP8HuHRVPdFKHr.jpg'),

Creighton Hale (24 May 1888 — 9 August 1965) was an Irish-American theatre, film, and television actor whose career extended more than a half-century, from the early 1900s to the end of the 1950s.

Born Patrick Fitzgerald in County Cork, Ireland, he was educated in Dublin and London, and later attended Ardingly College in Sussex. He immigrated to America in his early twenties, traveling with a troupe of actors. While starring in Charles Frohman''s Broadway production of Indian Summer, Hale was spotted by a representative of the Pathe Film Company. He eventually became known professionally as Creighton Hale, although the derivation of those names remains unknown. His first movie was The Exploits of Elaine in 1914. He starred in hit films such as Way Down East, Orphans of the Storm, and The Cat and the Canary.

When talkies came about, his career declined. He made several appearances in Hal Roach''s Our Gang series (School''s Out, Big Ears, Free Wheeling), and also played unbilled bits in major talking films such as Larceny, Inc., The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca.

He died in the Los Angeles County city of South Pasadena and was buried at Duncans Mills Cemetery in Northern California.

_[TMDb FYI add-on note: While online sites differ regarding Mr. Hale''s birth year, the United States Social Security Death Index indicates that he was born in 1888. When during his lifetime issuing Mr. Hale a Social Security number, the Social Security Administration would have required him to submit documentation proof, or sworn affadavits, of his accurate and true birth date, and his other identifying details.

Both Ernest and his actor brother David Torrence  came to America directly from Scotland prior to WWI. Focusing instead  on a purely acting career, both brothers developed into seasoned players  on the New York stage. Ernest made his Broadway bow with "Modest  Suzanne" in 1912 and a standout role in "The Night Boat" in 1920 brought  him to the attention of Hollywood filmmakers.

He earned superb marks playing the despicable adversary Luke Hatburn in Tol''able David (1921) opposite Richard Barthelmess,  and immediately settled into films for the rest of his career. Adept at  both comedy and drama, Ernest avoided what could have been a damaging  stereotype with his sympathetic portrayal of a grizzled old codger in  the classic western The Covered Wagon (1923). He further bolstered his celebrity with plum, lip-smacking roles alongside Lon Chaney in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) as Clopin, king of the beggars, and Betty Bronson in Peter Pan (1924) as the dastardly Captain Hook.

Hector William "Harry" Cording (26 April 1891 – 1 September 1954) was a British character actor.

Cording was born Hector William Cording on 26 April 1891 in Wellington, Somerset. He was brought up and was educated in his native England, and later settled permanently in Los Angeles, where he began a film career. His first role was as a henchmen in The Knockout (1925), followed by similar roles over the next few years. Cording appeared in many Hollywood films from the 1920s to the 1950s. With an imposing six-foot height, stocky build, and perhaps due to his uncomfortable resemblance to veteran film bad guy Oskar Homolka, "Harry the Henchman" usually portrayed thugs, villains'' henchmen and policemen.

Cording''s most notable roles were probably as the villainous Dickon Malbete, Captain of the Guard in Errol Flynn''s Adventures of Robin Hood and as Thamal, the hulking henchman to Bela Lugosi''s character in 1934''s Black Cat. As a contract player at Universal Pictures in the 1940s, he turned up in tiny parts in many of their horror films, such as The Wolf Man.

Having appeared in a bit role in 20th Century-Fox''s Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone (1939), he went on to appear in supporting and bit parts in seven of the twelve Universal Studios Sherlock Holmes films in which Rathbone starred.

Cording died on 1 September 1954. The cause of death was not documented. His wife was Margaret Cording, née Fiero, (1912–91), a native of Michigan; their daughter, Margaret Rose, was born on 7 November 1939. The Cordings lived at 4104 Farmdale Avenue, North Hollywood.

A 25-year veteran in the Hollywood exploitation field, writer/producer/director Jim Wynorski is responsible for over 150 varied motion pictures in a myriad of genres. Leaving behind a successful commercial business in New York, Wynorski relocated to California in 1980 and soon found himself on the doorstep of his childhood idol, B-film king Roger Corman. "The rest was destiny," recounts Wynorski, who soon found himself hired by the renowned movie mogul to cut "coming attractions" for all of the company''s new action and horror films. "It was like grasshopper learning from the kung-fu master," says Wynorski, who claims his six-months internship with Corman taught him more than four years at film school.

"It wasn''t long after that Corman offered me the first of many writing/directing assignments. Some distributor wanted a flick about a killer in a shopping mall," recalls Wynorski, "and Roger trusted me enough to say ''come up with something good, and you can direct it." Well, a couple days later, the director walked in with the first treatment to a film called Chopping Mall (1986), and the rest was history. From then on, Jim Wynorski turned out an average of three to five films a year as a director, and even more as a producer/writer. Throughout the 1980s came a steady stream of wild exploitation titles like Big Bad Mama II (1987) with Angie Dickinson, Not of This Earth (1988) with Traci Lords and The Return of Swamp Thing (1989) with Heather Locklear. On into the 1990s, Wynorski continued to climb to the top of the B-Film mountain with flicks like Hard Bounty (1995) starring Kelly LeBrock, Point of Seduction III: Body Chemistry (1994) &amp; Body Chemistry 4: Full Exposure (1995) with Shannon Tweed and Morgan Fairchild and Munchie (1992), which featured the first film appearance of the then-unknown 12-year-old child actress Jennifer Love Hewitt.

As the years peeled by and tastes changed, Jim Wynorski kept hip by innovating new special effects techniques that landed the director no less than seven world premieres on the Sci-Fi Channel. His credits there include films like Gargoyle (2004), The Curse of the Komodo (2004), Project Viper and Cry of the Winged Serpent (2007).

As for the future, the 59-year-old Wynorski feels the audience for alternative cinema made away from the studio system will continue to grow thanks to new advances in Internet and Cable technologies. In fact, he is in post-production on another thriller, Vampire in Vegas (2009). "And you can bet I''ll be there," he offers with a big smile, "with some really fun stuff." Jim has a huge following in the Mid-West and is beloved in Franklin, Indiana, Home of The B Movie Celebration.

Andrew W. "Andy" Sidaris (February 20, 1931 – March 7, 2007) was an American television and film director, film producer, actor, and screenwriter.

Sidaris was best known for his Bullets, Bombs, and Babes or Bullets, Bombs, and Boobs (BBB for short) series of B-movies produced between 1985 and 1998. These films featured a rotating "stock company" of actors mostly made up of Playboy Playmates and Penthouse "Pets", including Julie Strain, Dona Speir, Hope Marie Carlton, Cynthia Brimhall, Roberta Vasquez, Julie K. Smith, Shae Marks, and Wendy Hamilton. Several of his films were done wholly or largely in Shreveport using many local actors or actors with local ties.

Before the B-movies, Sidaris was a pioneer in sports television. He directed coverage of hundreds of football and basketball games, Olympic events, and special programs and won seven Emmy awards for his work in the field. His best known work was with ABC''s Wide World of Sports; he was the show''s first director, and continued in that post for 25 years.

Sidaris pioneered what he called the "honey shot", close-ups of cheerleaders and pretty girls in the stands at sporting events. He won an Emmy Award in 1969 for directing the Summer Olympics. He expanded into dramatic television in the 1970s, directing episodes of programs like Gemini Man (1976), CBS''s Kojak (mid-1970s), ABC''s The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries (late-1970s) and ABC''s Monday Night Football.

He expanded into film, specializing in action flicks featuring buxom gun-toting Playboy Playmates and Penthouse Pets with titles like Fit to Kill and Savage Beach. Most of Sidaris'' "Triple B" series (later given the title L.E.T.H.A.L. Ladies) focused on the adventures of a team of secret agents and were mostly filmed in Hawaii. Several entries in the series were merely produced by him and were written and directed by others. Although the series featured recurring characters, continuity between films was not a priority and it was common for an actress who played a villain (and was killed off) in one film to re-appear in a subsequent film as a hero.

With his wife, Arlene T. Sidaris (born ca. 1942) as his production partner, Sidaris made twelve films. After Sidaris'' death, she runs the official websites of his twelve films.', 'Chicago, Illinois, U.S.', 1, '/j1EL3PHtmqNYekO1QDTdIGA1o5.jpg'),

George Delbert "Dell" Henderson (July 5, 1877 – December 2, 1956) was a Canadian-American actor, director, and writer. He began his long and prolific film career in the early days of silent film.

Born in the Southwestern Ontario city of St. Thomas, Dell Henderson started his acting career on the stage, but appeared in his first movie Monday Morning in a Coney Island Police Court already in 1908. Henderson was a frequent associate of film pioneer D.W. Griffith since 1909 and appeared in numerous of his early shorts in Hollywood. He also acted on a less prolific basis in the movies of producer Mack Sennett and his Keystone Studios. In addition to acting, Henderson also directed nearly 200 silent films between 1911 and 1928. Most of those films are forgotten or lost, but he also directed movies with silent stars like Harry Carey and Roscoe Arbuckle. Henderson also worked as a writer on numerous screenplays.

After retiring from directing in 1927, Henderson turned to acting full-time and played important supporting roles in King Vidor''s The Crowd (1928) and as General Marmaduke Pepper in Show People (1928). The advent of sound film damaged his acting career, and he often had to play smaller roles. In the 1930s, the comedic character actor appeared on several occasions as a comic foil for such comedians as The Three Stooges, W. C. Fields and Laurel and Hardy. He often played somewhat pompous figures like judges, businessmen, detectives or mayors. Modern audiences will remember Henderson as annoyed hospital president Dr. Graves in The Three Stooges film Men in Black and the put-upon chaperone in the Little Rascals film Choo-Choo!. He also appeared as a Night Court Judge in Laurel and Hardy''s Our Relations (1936) and as a friendly Car salesman in Leo McCarey''s drama Make Way for Tomorrow (1937). Henderson ended his film career after numerous small roles in 1950.

Potel''s first talking picture was Melody of Love, starring Walter Pidgeon, made for Universal in 1928. and in the sound era he continued to work continuously and constantly, playing small parts and sometimes uncredited bit parts, all primarily comic roles due to his height (6 ft 1 in or 1.85 m) and gawkiness.

In addition to acting, on several occasions Potel also wrote and directed. In the 1920s he directed two silent shorts, The Rubber-Neck in 1924 and Action Craver in 1927, and contributed the story for Saxophobia in 1927.

That peculiar but apt identification seems to be the exclusive property of Herschell Gordon Lewis. With an unusual background that included teaching English Literature to college students, producing and directing television commercials, and voicing radio and television commercials, Herschell literally - and single-handedly - established the "Splatter Film" category of motion pictures. He accomplished this by writing and directing (including the musical score) a mini-budget movie titled "Blood Feast," shot in Miami in 1963 and released theatrically the following year. As critics lambasted the primitive effects and inattention to script and sub-par acting, audiences flocked to theaters to see why friends who had reacted to the movie''s fiery marketing campaign had said, "You gotta see this." Armed with boxoffice grosses, Herschell and his producer-partner David Friedman quickly decided to build onto their newly-discovered base. Herschell wrote and directed "Two Thousand Maniacs." The lead singer of the musical group hired to perform background music had a tenor voice. Herschell had written the title song, "The South Gonna Rise Ag''in." He wanted a baritone, and without hesitation he made the switch: the voice on the sound track is his. After their third splatter film, "Color Me Blood Red," David Friedman moved to California, engaging in a different type of motio0n picture. Herschell continued to grind out one success after another, with titles such as "The Gruesome Twosome," "The Wizard of Gore," and "The Gore-Gore Girls." When major film companies began to invade his splatter-turf, Herschell took a hiatus, shifting full time to his "other career," writing advertising and mailings for marketers worldwide. He became one of a handful of experts to be inducted into the Direct Marketing Association''s Hall of Fame. (Author of 32 books on marketing including the classic "On the Art of Writing Copy," Herschell is often called on to lecture on copywriting, just as he is invited to sing the theme from "Two Thousand Maniacs" at horror film festivals.) Over the years, an unusual reality came into place: Herschell''s old films continued to play not just on TV screens but in theatres, years after conventional movies would have disappeared altogether. The result has been renewal of his life as a film director. Thus it is that a new Herschell Gordon Lewis movie is hoving into view: "Herschell Gordon Lewis''s BloodMania," produced by James Saito in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and planned for 2015 release. Both the producer and the director encapsulate their opinion of "Herschell Gordon Lewis''s BloodMania" in a single word: Enthusiastic.

David Llewelyn Wark Griffith (January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948) was a premier pioneering American film director. He is best known as the director of the controversial and groundbreaking 1915 film The Birth of a Nation and the subsequent film Intolerance (1916).

Griffith''s film The Birth of a Nation made pioneering use of advanced camera and narrative techniques, and its immense popularity set the stage for the dominance of the feature-length film. It also proved extremely controversial at the time and ever since for its negative depiction of Black Americans and their supporters, and its positive portrayal of slavery and the Ku Klux Klan. Griffith responded to his critics with his next film, Intolerance, intended to show the dangers of prejudiced thought and behavior. The film was not the financial success that its predecessor had been, but was received warmly by critics. Several of his later films were also successful, but high production, promotional, and roadshow costs often made his ventures commercial failures. Even so, he is generally considered one of the most important figures of early cinema.

She was active in the 1970s Los Angeles pornography scene, appearing in more than 80 films and loops. She was noted for her petite figure and conveyed innocence or naivete in her acting approach.

She was one of the first actresses in the porn industry to get breast implants, and in a 1977 interview stated that this decision was in response to the "North American Breast Fetish". As a result, she claims that she was offered more parts in films. By the mid-70s, she had started her own mail-order company, selling still photos of herself and slides from her work. Her parents were aware of her work, and accompanied her when she performed at burlesque and strip-tease shows. During these shows, Bond invited her father on stage, where she performed to the song "My Heart Belongs to Daddy".

Bond was a member of the AVN Hall of Fame as well as the X-Rated Critics Organization Hall of Fame.

Like them, Jack Warner made his name in music hall and radio, but he became known to cinema audiences as the patriarch in a trio of popular post-World War II family films beginning with Here Come the Huggetts. He also co-starred in the 1955 Hammer film version of The Quatermass Xperiment and as a police superintendent in the 1955 Ealing Studios black comedy The Ladykillers.

Warner attended the Coopers'' Company''s Grammar School for Boys in Mile End, while his sisters both attended the nearby sister school, Coborn School for Girls in Bow. The three children were choristers at St. Leonard''s Church, Bromley-by-Bow, and for a time, Warner was the choir''s soloist.

By the early war years Warner was nationally known and starred in a BBC radio comedy show Garrison Theatre, invariably opening with, "A Monologue Entitled...".

It was in 1949 that Warner first played the role for which he would be remembered, PC George Dixon, in the film The Blue Lamp. One observer predicted, "This film will make Jack the most famous policeman in Britain". Although the police constable was shot dead in the film, the character was revived in 1955 for the BBC television series Dixon of Dock Green, which ran until 1976. In later years though, Warner and his long-past-retirement-age character were confined to a less prominent desk sergeant role. The series had a prime-time slot on Saturday evenings, and always opened with Dixon giving a little soliloquy to the camera, beginning with the words, "Good evening, all". According to Warner''s autobiography, Jack of All Trades, Elizabeth II once visited the television studio where the series was made and told Warner "that she thought Dixon of Dock Green had become part of the British way of life".

He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1965. In 1973, he was made a Freeman of the City of London. Warner commented in his autobiography that the honour "entitles me to a set of 18th century rules for the conduct of life urging me to be sober and temperate". Warner added, "Not too difficult with Dixon to keep an eye on me!"

The characterisation by Warner of Dixon was held in such high regard that officers from Paddington Green Police Station bore the coffin at his funeral in 1981.

Warner is buried in East London Cemetery.  Description above from the Wikipedia article Jack Warner (actor), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.', 'London, England, UK', 1, '/8X3laNawVEQN89yCo1DusVSJMi6.jpg'),

He played Carl Wilson in the 2000 miniseries The Beach Boys: An American Family. He is the founding member of FUDDYTV.com and the character now known on the Internet as Chuck Storm Action 5 News Reporter who hits pole.

In May 2008 Ryan and FUDDY compatriots David Haysom and Erik Eldman traveled to Belgium on behalf of Toyota to film Car Dance Party Belgium which has become a cult favorite in Belgium.  The ad features two of FUDDYTV.com''s recurring characters, Boris and Juri, as they instruct us in the art of the car dance party. Their car dance party work has gone on to garner them a win in a SuperU.ca contest which includes a showing of Car Dance Party Moscow at Just For Laughs in Montreal and a MIXX award for their Car Dance Party Belgium Campaign in partnership with Happiness Brussels.

In December 2008 Ryan and FUDDYTV worked hand in hand with TrueCredit''s ad agency Cramer-Krasselt to create 10 commercials for web and TV, the most widespread of which is the Chuck Storm commercial.

A former Catholic schoolgirl, Sandra became a stripper in her late teens then started her show business career in her early 20s wrestling for Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (G.L.O.W.) under the stage name Tiffany Mellon; usually as part of the tag team "Park Avenue Knockouts." However, she left prematurely after facing harassment and homophobia from a G.L.O.W. manager who thought she and another wrestler were lesbians. Still, TV exposure on the syndicated series landed her her very first acting roles, including a guest spot on My Two Days and a supporting part in the wrestling drama American Angels: Baptism of Blood in 1989. Now bitten by the acting bug, Sandra switched her professional name yet again to Sandra Margot and started carving out a niche for herself in B movies. She played a seductive demon in Demon Wind, a hellish nun in Spirits, a teenage murder victim in The Sleeping Car and also landed parts in the women-in-prison film Caged Fury and a few other films, plus played a stripper on TV''s Tales from the Crypt. The only constant were that the roles were small and almost always required nudity.

Likely sick of landing nothing but nondescript bits in low budget films, Margot left her mainstream film aspirations behind, changed her name again to Tiffany Million (sometimes Tyffany Million) and went where she could become a star: hardcore porn. There she was much more successful and, from 1992 until her final X film appearance in 1997, Sandra became one of the most in demand adult stars of the decade. Some of her most successful ventures were American Garter, New Wave Hookers III, Sex, Latex (the top-selling adult video of 1995) and its 1996 sequel Shock. She even poked fun at her former wrestling days with a film called B.L.O.W. (Beautiful Ladies of Wrestling). Sandra won an XRCO (X-Rated Critics Organization) Award, two AVN Awards and even directed, wrote and produced a handful of films, including The XXX Files: Lust in Space (1995), for her own production company Immaculate Video Conceptions. After receiving a sizable inheritance, she quit the adult film industry and never returned.

Leaving her sex star days behind, Sandra became a bounty hunter, bail bondswoman and then a private investigator. She emerged yet again a decade later, this time as Sandra Scott (surname from her fourth husband), as star of the short-lived reality show Wife, Mom, Bounty Hunter, which aired on the WE Network in 2007. Afterward, Sandra was interviewed about her adult film days in After Porn Ends (2012) and has reinvented herself yet again in 2017, also using a new name ("Margot Monday"), as the host of Arizona talk radio show.', 'Richmond, California, USA', 2, '/9sd3sC6C90H8AfKrwnb1ffSfDLh.jpg'),

Billy Bevan (born William Bevan Harris, 29 September 1887 – 26 November 1957) was an Australian-born vaudevillian, who became an American film actor. He appeared in 254 American films between 1916 and 1950.

Bevan was born in the country town of Orange, New South Wales, Australia. He went on the stage at an early age, traveled to Sydney and spent eight years in Australian light opera, performing as Willie Bevan. He sailed to America with the Pollard’s Lilliputian Opera Company in 1912 and later toured Canada. Bevan broke into films with the Sigmund Lubin studio in 1916. When the company disbanded, Bevan became a supporting actor in Mack Sennett movie comedies. An expressive pantomimist, Bevan''s quiet scene-stealing attracted attention, and by 1922 Bevan was a Sennett star. He supplemented his income, however, by establishing a citrus and avocado farm at Escondido, California.

Usually filmed wearing a derby hat and a drooping mustache, Bevan may not have possessed an indelible screen character like Charlie Chaplin but he had a friendly, funny presence in the frantic Sennett comedies. Much of the comedy depended on Bevan''s skilled timing and reactions; the famous "oyster" routine performed on film by Curly Howard, Lou Costello, and Huntz Hall—in which a bowl of "fresh oyster stew" shows alarming signs of life and battles the guy trying to eat it—was originated on film decades earlier by Bevan in the short film Wandering Willies.

By the mid-1920s Bevan was often teamed with Andy Clyde; Clyde soon graduated to his own starring series. The late 1920s found Bevan playing in wild marital farces for Sennett.

The advent of talking pictures took their toll on the careers of many silent stars, including Billy Bevan. Bevan began a second career in "talkies" as a character actor and bit player in roles such as that of a bus driver in the 1929 film High Voltage, a hotel employee in the Mae Murray film Peacock Alley, and the supporting role of Second Lieutenant Trotter in Journey''s End in 1930. His starring roles had come to an end, however, and for the next 20 years he often would play rowdy Cockneys (as in Pack Up Your Troubles with The Ritz Brothers), and affable Englishmen (as in Tin Pan Alley and Terror by Night). He played a friendly bus conductor opposite Greer Garson in one of the opening scenes of Mrs. Miniver.

Bevan died in 1957 in Escondido, California, just before new audiences discovered him in Robert Youngson''s silent-comedy compilations. (The Youngson films mispronounce his name as "Be-VAN"; Bevan himself offered the proper pronunciation in a Voice of Hollywood reel in 1930.)', 'Orange, New South Wales, Australia', 1, '/b71bTzqUZ60ij9aErlaat6BWkTK.jpg'),

Douglas Hickox (10 January 1929 – 25 July 1988) was an English film director. Hickox was born in London, where he was educated at Emanuel School. Hickox worked extensively as an assistant director and second unit director throughout the 50''s and early 60''s, making his first major picture in 1970. Over the next ten years, he developed a reputation for the wit and style of his direction, and for his taut action sequences. His work includes Les Bicyclettes de Belsize (1968), Entertaining Mr Sloane (1969), Theatre of Blood (1973) and Zulu Dawn (1979).

Hickox was married to Anne V. Coates, the Oscar winning editor of Lawrence of Arabia. After his death in 1988, his second wife Annabel approached the BIFA (British Independent Film Awards) with an annual bequest from Douglas'' estate. This bequest led directly to the creation of the British Independent Film Awards. In recognition of Douglas''s commitment and support for new talent, BIFA inaugurated the Douglas Hickox Award, which is given to a British director on their debut feature.

Douglas Hickox''s sons, Anthony Hickox and James D.R. Hickox are also film directors and one of his daughters, Emma, a film editor. Anthony Hickox''s best known work is perhaps Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992), whilst he was Executive Producer on Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest (1995) directed by James D.R. Hickox. Emma E. Hickox''s career has probably taken her the furthest though with films like The Jacket, Kinky Boots, Blood and Chocolate, Blue Crush, Becoming Jane and A Walk to Remember on her CV.

Bert I. Gordon (born Bert Ira Gordon, September 24, 1922 in Kenosha, WI) is an American film director most famous for such science fiction and horror B-movies as The Amazing Colossal Man and Village of the Giants.

Most of Gordon''s work is in the idiom of giant monster films, for which he used rear-projection to create the special effects. His nickname "Mister B.I.G." is a reference both to his initials and to his preferred technique for making super-sized creatures.

Gordon began his career directing television commercials before moving to film in 1954 to produce Serpent Island. In 1957 he began his prolific association with American International Pictures.

In 1960, he wrote, produced and directed The Boy and the Pirates, starring active and popular child star of the time Charles Herbert and Gordon''s own daughter, Susan. The three of them recently appeared together in the celebrity lineup at the 2006 Monster Bash, held June 23-25 at the Pittsburgh (PA) Airport Four Points. Walt Disney Company''s theatrical release of Johnny Depp''s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man''s Chest, on July 7, 2006, spiked interest in previous "pirate" films. To that end Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, released a Midnite Movies double DVD set with the rarely seen The Boy and the Pirates, and the more recent Crystalstone (1988), on June 27, 2006.

His 1977 Empire of the Ants featured a pre-Dynasty Joan Collins, who later said of the film that it was her worst acting experience, but by then the loosely-based modernized H. G. Wells tale had been elevated to cult film status.

None of his films has received significant critical attention, but his work has attained popularity in some circles. The cult TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) has featured several of his movies, listed below.

Gordon holds a degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Bert I. Gordon has appeared recently annually in the celebrity lineup at the Monster Bash, held each June, at the Pittsburgh, PA Airport Four Points.

He later made frequent television appearances including seven episodes of The Lone Ranger from 1949 to 1954. His Stooge film appearance was in The Three Stooges Meet Hercules.

Ralph Bates (12 February 1940 – 27 March 1991) was an English film and television actor, known for his role in the British sitcom Dear John and for being one of Hammer Horror''s best-known actors from the latter period of the company.

Bates was born in Bristol, England, of French ancestry (He was the great, great nephew of French scientist Louis Pasteur) and educated at Trinity College Dublin. He read French there, before winning a scholarship to Yale Drama School. The course completed, Bates returned to Ireland to make his stage debut in Shaw''s You Never Can Tell at The Gate Theatre, Dublin, in 1963. A career in repertory theatre soon followed and the young actor gained experience in productions ranging from Hedda Gabler, to raucous comedies.

Later, Bates carved a niche in the world of horror films and played important roles or the lead in several Hammer Horror productions, such as Taste the Blood of Dracula, The Horror of Frankenstein, Lust for a Vampire, and Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, in which he played a deranged doctor who mistakenly transforms himself into a beautiful siren.

He portrayed Caligula in the series The Caesars and alongside Cyd Hayman in a passionate French tale of murder and mystery - Crime of Passion series. After playing Thomas Culpeper in an episode of The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970), he went on to star in the BBC drama series, Moonbase 3 (1973) and the long-running Poldark, in which he played villainous George Warleggan. The series ran for 29 episodes, starting in 1975. He also played Communist Paul Vercors in the final season of the drama series Secret Army. Because of his French ancestry and dark looks, he was often chosen to play a Frenchman on television. Bates also appeared in the television movie Minder on the Orient Express, again as a Frenchman.

It looked, for some time, as if he might remain typecast in sinister roles, but he was offered a part in a farcical comedy by the writer John Sullivan, which saw Bates as the loveable but loveless central character among a singles group, with each of its members looking for that perfect but ever elusive partner. Dear John (1986–87), in which he realistically played the part of a divorcee returning to single life, lasted for two series, and around the same time he appeared in the ITV Yorkshire Television sitcom Farrington of the F.O. (1986) with Angela Thorne and Joan Sims.

Bates became ill and was diagnosed with cancer. He died in London at age 51 from pancreatic cancer. He was divorced from the actress Joanna Van Gyseghem, and survived by his second wife, the actress Virginia Wetherell (married 1973-1991). The couple had one daughter actress Daisy Bates (b. 1974), and a son William Bates (b. 1977), an actor &amp; musician.

The name may not be as familiar but his adorable, jug-eared presence was a well-known commodity throughout the Hollywood community at the time, and he was considered a reliable and talented tyke who could easily turn on the waterworks on command. He was French-Canadian, born in Montreal on January 15, 1948. His birth name was Bernard Girouard. His family relocated to Los Angeles where the boy started dance classes at age 3. He made a reputable debut on TV playing Prince Edward of Wales, the son of Henry VIII, on a "Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentation starring Sarah Churchill. As one who could easily tug at the heartstrings, he often played sympathetic young boys with afflictions, such as his crippled youngster on an episode of "My Friend Flicka" or his wealthy asthmatic on "Medic". Tommy hit his TV peak at age 10 after being cast as Jody in the gentle, non-violent TV western 

Buckskin (1958) opposite Sally Brophy, who played his widowed mom. Set in the frontier town of Buckskin, Montana, the show was seen from his young perspective, narrating each episode sitting on his corral fence and playing his harmonica. Although it only played for one full season, Tommy had comic books out with his character and his autograph was well in demand at parades, conventions and other public outings. 

After the series'' demise, Tommy continued on other shows, many of them westerns such as "Rawhide", "The Rifleman", "Gunsmoke" and "Wagon Train", not to mention recurring roles on "Lassie". Unable to find another regular series that could maintain the momentum, he also was starting to move in his awkward teens stage and this pretty much signified that the end was not far away. After years of scattered parts here and there, including a role in the exploitation film Maryjane (1968), he ended his career with a small part in the movie The Moonshine War (1970). Later years were spent as a writer, penning articles for a number of publications including "Playboy", the "Los Angeles Times" and the "Village Voice". He returned to acting as a young adult (shortening his name to the grown-up-sounding Tom Nolan) with a small part in the Richard Gere

 film Yanks (1979) and has since given it the old college try, appearing as a minor player in such films as Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982),Up the Creek (1984), School Spirit (1985), Pretty Woman (1990), The Thing Called Love(1993) and White Man''s Burden (1995). His most recent credit was as a valet in Batman Begins (2005). On TV he has been glimpsed in everything from waiters to courtroom deputies. Now having entered his fifth decade of acting, Tom continues to live in the San Fernando Valley area. - IMDb Mini Biography By: Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net', 'Montréal, Québec, Canada', 1, '/AtyP7vlyxsSWsXGmTHo6flEyPkG.jpg'),

Dawn Elberta Wells (born October 18, 1938) is an American actress who is best known for her role as Mary Ann Summers on the CBS sitcom Gilligan''s Island. She and Tina Louise are the last surviving regular cast members from that series.

In Hollywood, Wells made her debut on ABC''s The Roaring 20s and the movie The New Interns and was cast in episodes of such television series as 77 Sunset Strip, The Cheyenne Show, Maverick, and Bonanza, before she took the role of Mary Ann on Gilligan''s Island. She reprised her character in the various Gilligan''s Island reunion specials, including the reunion cartoon spin-off Gilligan''s Planet and three reunion movies: Rescue from Gilligan''s Island, The Castaways on Gilligan''s Island, and The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan''s Island.

She also appeared as a guest star on Wagon Train, Tales of Wells Fargo, 87th Precinct, Surfside 6, Hawaiian Eye, Ripcord, The Everglades, The Detectives, It''s a Man''s World, Channing, Laramie, Burke''s Law, The Invaders, The Wild Wild West, The F.B.I., Vega$, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Matt Houston, ALF, Herman''s Head, Three Sisters, Pastor Greg, and Roseanne.

Following Gilligan''s Island, Wells embarked on a theater career, appearing in nearly one hundred theatrical productions as of July 2009. She spent the majority of the 1970s, and 1980s, touring in musical theater productions. She also had a one-woman show at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 1985.

In 1993, Wells published Mary Ann''s Gilligan''s Island Cookbook with co-writers Ken Beck and Jim Clark, including a foreword by Bob Denver. She was close to Alan Hale Jr., who played The Skipper in Gilligan''s Island, even after the series completed its run, and he contributed a family recipe ("Kansas Chicken and Dumplings") to her cookbook. Hale''s character was the inspiration behind such concoctions as Skipper''s Coconut Pie, Skipper''s Navy Bean Soup, and Skipper''s Goodbye Ribeye, and he is depicted as Skipper Jonas Grumby in numerous photographs throughout the book. She said in a 2014 interview with GoErie.com, "Alan could not have been kinder to a young actress. He was a real peach."

In 2005, Wells consigned her original gingham blouse and shorts ensemble for sale from her signature role. Beverly Hills auction house Profiles in History sold it for $20,700. In 2008, she joined Gilligan''s Island creator Sherwood Schwartz in Los Angeles for the celebration of Schwartz''s entry into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She appeared on the "Celebrity Holiday Bash" episode of Food Network''s Chopped, which first aired December 1, 2013.

In 2014, Wells released What Would Mary Ann Do? A Guide to Life, which she co-wrote with Steve Stinson. The book was released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Gilligan''s Island.

Gilligan''s Island co-star Russell Johnson died on January 16, 2014, and Wells and Tina Louise are the only surviving cast members of the sitcom. In May 2016, Wells was named Marketing Ambassador to MeTV Network. In January 2019, Wells was seen promoting the Gilligan''s Island television series on the MeTV television network.

Maria arrived in the United States at the outbreak of war in 1938 and first performed on the New York stage, notably in the 1942 production of "The Moon Is Down." Spotted for films, she was one of many foreign actresses Hollywood took in at the time to fill their quota of exotic mystery ladies in war-era intrigue and film noir. She made her debut in Mission to Moscow (1943) for Warner Bros. and continued on freelancing for other studios with Days of Glory (1944), opposite Gregory Peck, Lady on a Train (1944), The Web (1947), The Other Love (1947), Strictly Dishonorable (1941), By the Light of the Silvery Moon (1953), and Outcasts of the City (1958), among others.

Her film career waned in the 1950s and she turned to radio, TV and commercials. She formed her own production company, Maria Palmer Enterprises, and hosted her own local Los Angeles show "Sincerely, Maria Palmer" in the early 1960s. In later years she wrote a number of unproduced teleplays, often under the pseudonym Eliot Parker White. Dying of pulmonary failure while battling cancer in 1981, she kept extensive journals of her life and career which were later available to the public.

Fritz Reuter Leiber Sr. (January 31, 1882 – October 14, 1949), was an American actor. A Shakespearean actor on stage, he also had a successful career in film. He was the father of science fiction and fantasy writer Fritz Leiber, Jr., who was also an actor for a time.

Leiber and his wife spent much of their time touring in a Shakespearian acting company, known by the 1930s as Fritz Leiber & Co. Leiber made his film bow in 1916, playing Mercutio in the Francis X. Bushman version of Romeo and Juliet. With his piercing eyes and shock of white hair, Leiber seemed every inch the priests, professors, musical professors, and religious fanatics that he was frequently called upon to play in films. His many silent-era portrayals included Caesar in Theda Bara''s 1917 Cleopatra and Solomon in the mammoth 1921 Betty Blythe vehicle The Queen of Sheba.

He thrived as a character actor in sound films, usually in historical roles. In the film Champagne Waltz, he portrayed an orchestra maestro; the role required him to play classical music on a violin and jazz on a clarinet. One of Leiber''s larger assignments of the 1940s, and his most notable musical role, was as Franz Liszt in the Claude Rains remake of Phantom of the Opera (1943).

Leiber appears together with his son Fritz Leiber, Jr. in the wedding-feast scene of Greta Garbo''s film Camille (1936) and in Warner Bros.'' The Great Garrick (1937). Leiber also appeared with his son Fritz Leiber, Jr. in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) but Fritz Leiber, Jr. was not credited for his small speaking part.

Late in his career, Leiber performed briefly opposite Charles Chaplin as the priest who visits Monsieur Verdoux in his prison cell.', 'Chicago, Illinois, USA', 1, '/1cwoZyUK5XchzNcXgrRhoMXK84r.jpg'),

Rafaela Ottiano (4 March 1888 – 18 August 1942) was an Italian-born American stage and film actress.

Born in Venice, Italy, she emigrated with her parents to the United States, and was processed at Ellis Island, in 1910. Ottiano established herself as a stage actress in Europe before arriving in Hollywood in 1924 and appearing in American motion pictures. Ottiano''s first film was in the John L. McCutcheon-directed drama The Law and the Lady (1924) opposite actors Len Leo, Alice Lake, and Tyrone Power, Sr.

Ottiano was part of the original 1928 Broadway cast of the Mae West hit play Diamond Lil and reprised her role as Rita when the play was made into a film as She Done Him Wrong (1933), directed by Lowell Sherman. Throughout the 1930s, Rafaela Ottiano would often specialize in roles as sinister, maleveolent, or spiteful women, such as her role in the Tod Browning-directed horror film The Devil-Doll (1936), opposite Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O''Sullivan.

Other notable film roles for Ottiano include Lena in As You Desire Me (1932) with Greta Garbo, Melvyn Douglas, Erich von Stroheim, Owen Moore, and Hedda Hopper; Mrs. Higgins in the Shirley Temple musical-comedy Curly Top (1935); as a matron in the crime-drama Riffraff (1936), starring Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy; and as Suzette, Greta Garbo''s devoted maid, in the Edmund Goulding-directed drama Grand Hotel (1932). When Grand Hotel was turned into a Broadway Musical in 1989, her character was renamed Rafaela Ottiano in honor of the actress.

Ottiano''s last film was the musical comedy I Married an Angel (1942), starring Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. During her career in film, she appeared in approximately 45 motion pictures, opposite such actors as Barbara Stanwyck, Conrad Nagel, Peter Lorre, Zasu Pitts, and Katharine Hepburn.

Ottiano lived in the Times Square area during the Prohibition Era and never married. She died in 1942 in East Boston, Massachusetts of intestinal cancer at the age of 54.

Mae West (born Mary Jane West; August 17, 1893 – November 22, 1980) was an American actress, playwright, screenwriter and sex symbol whose entertainment career spanned seven decades. Known for her bawdy double entendres, West made a name for herself in vaudeville and on the stage in New York before moving to Hollywood to become a comedienne, actress and writer in the motion picture industry. In consideration of her contributions to American cinema, the American Film Institute named West 15th among the greatest female stars of all time. One of the more controversial movie stars of her day, West encountered many problems including censorship. When her cinematic career ended, she continued to perform on stage, in Las Vegas, in the United Kingdom, on radio and television, and recorded rock and roll albums. She used the alias Jane Mast early in her career.

Gordon Wynnivo Jones (April 5, 1911 – June 20, 1963) was an American character actor, a member of John Wayne''s informal acting company best known for playing Lou Costello''s TV nemesis "Mike the Cop" and appearing as The Green Hornet in the first of two movie serials based on that old-time radio program.

Iowa-born Jones had been a student athlete and star football guard ("Bull" Jones) at University of California, Los Angeles, and had also played a few seasons of professional football. He started out playing small roles in Wesley Ruggles'' and Ernest B. Schoedsack''s The Monkey''s Paw (1933), his first credited role in Sam Wood''s Let ''Em Have It (1935), and Sidney Lanfield''s Red Salute (1935). By 1937, he had moved on to a contract at RKO Radio Pictures. In 1940, Jones had the title role in The Green Hornet but did not reprise the role in the sequel.

Jones held a reserve commission in the army and was called into the service after filming his roles as "The Wreck" in My Sister Eileen (1942) and "Alabama Smith" in Flying Tigers (1942), a John Wayne vehicle that was one of the most popular action films of the war. This picture began Jones'' 20-year onscreen association with Wayne, who was also a former football player at the University of Southern California.

Jones remained associated with the service after the war, encouraging college students to consider the Reserve Officers'' Training Corps. After resuming his acting career in the late 1940s, Jones appeared in prominent roles in the John Wayne features Big Jim McLain (1952) and Island in the Sky (1953).

By the end of the 1940s, Jones had aged into a beefier screen presence and into very physical character roles. He was no longer a leading man but he had developed a comic villain persona which meshed with the work of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Jones'' association with the duo began in The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap (1947) with the role of the film''s heavy, Jake Frame, and continued through their television series The Abbott and Costello Show. Jones played "Mike the Cop", Costello''s hulking, loud-voiced antagonist. The program was produced for only two seasons, but ensured continued recognition for Jones via frequent reruns and a 21st Century DVD release.

Jones also remained busy in films and on television throughout the 1950s, in pictures that ranged from the sci-fi chiller The Monster That Challenged the World to the Tony Curtis/Janet Leigh sex comedy The Perfect Furlough, and on TV series ranging from The Real McCoys to The Rifleman. Jones also appeared in two very successful Disney movies during the early ''60s, The Absent-Minded Professor and Son of Flubber. He played harried school coaches in both pictures. He also starred with Mitzi Green and Virginia Gibson in the short-lived TV sitcom So This Is Hollywood (1955), and had a recurring role as neighbor Butch Barton during the early years of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet

Jones returned to the John Wayne stock company portraying Douglas, the bureaucrat antagonist to Wayne''s G.W. McLintock in the Western comedy McLintock! (1963). Jones unexpectedly succumbed to a heart attack on June 12, 1963, five months before the release of that movie.

Jules Munshin (February 22, 1915 – February 19, 1970) was a song-and-dance artist who had made his name on Broadway when he starred in Call Me Mister. Additional Broadway credits include The Gay Life and Barefoot in the Park.

Although Munshin was in successful MGM musicals such as Easter Parade and Take Me Out to the Ball Game, audiences would always remember him as one of the trio of sailors (along with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra) singing "New York, New York" in the hit film On the Town (1949). Another of his great roles was Bibinski, a Russian Commisar in Silk Stockings (1957).

Munshin died at the age of 54 from a heart attack, three days before his 55th birthday.

Stoker was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Prior to his role as Lt. Bishop, Stoker appeared in several blaxploitation films, often playing police detectives. Among these films were Abby (1974), The Zebra Killer (1975), and Sheba, Baby (1975), in which he played Pam Grier''s love interest. Some of Stoker''s other notable acting roles were in the 1973 science fiction film Battle for the Planet of the Apes, the 1974 disaster film Airport 1975, and the 1977 television mini-series Roots.

Stoker is known to Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans for his role as Dr. Ken Melrose in the 1982 B-movie, Being from Another Planet (also known as Time Walker), in which he appeared with Darwin Joston, his co-star from Assault on Precinct 13.

While his most recent character, Admiral Forrest, was killed in action on Star Trek: Enterprise, Armstrong got the chance to play Forrest again in the two-part episode "In a Mirror, Darkly", in which the Mirror Universe version of Forrest appears.

Other work

Outside of Star Trek, Armstrong appeared on Babylon 5 as a security guard affiliated with the Nightwatch in the 1996 episodes "Messages from Earth" and "Point of No Return". He appeared in an episode of Seinfeld as a detective, and in Quantum Leap, he guest starred in the episode "It''s A Wonderful Leap" as Fred Trump (father of Donald Trump), alongside future Enterprise co-star Scott Bakula.

He appeared as President Krieger in Disruptor (video game) released in 1996.

Armstrong''s talents extend into the musical arena. He has mastered the ukulele, using a "banjo"-style ukulele he made himself. With it he entertains audiences with Civil War-era songs and roots music, leading into the blues music he plays with others. His Trek-related blues songs are popular at convention appearances. His filk-song band, The Enterprise Blues Band, includes fellow Trek actors Richard Herd (Owen Paris), Steve Rankin (Colonel Green and other roles), and Casey Biggs (Damar).

Hayes won the title of Miss District of Columbia. She went on to represent D.C. in the 1949 Miss America pageant. Although she did not win the competition, it provided her with the opportunity to work in local television before moving to Hollywood to work for Universal Pictures in 1954. Taking the name Allison Hayes, she played small roles in a handful of films at Universal for a couple of years. In 1955 she filed a lawsuit against the studio over injuries she sustained while filming her second picture, SIGN OF THE PAGAN. Universal released Hayes from her contract, and she was subsequently signed by Columbia Pictures.

After appearing in a handful of Columbia films including COUNT THREE AND PRAY, MOHAWK, and WOLF DOG, Hayes was given in the lead role in ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN (1958). The film would eventually gain a cult following and become the performance for which she is best known. However, it did not escalate Hayes''s career at the time. For several years she remained consistently employed in movies and on television (including an extended stint on the soap opera "General Hospital" and several appearances on her friend Raymond Burr''s "Perry Mason" series).

By the mid-1960s, though, Allison Hayes''s career was all but over and she was beset by health problems. She would later admit that the pain of her illness led her to contemplate suicide, and that her symptoms were not taken seriously by doctors. After reading about metal poisoning in factory workers and recognizing the similarity of the symptoms described to her own, she hired a toxicologist to test a calcium supplement she''d been using for an extended time. The tests revealed that the pills contained an extreme amount of lead, and that Hayes was likely suffering from lead poisoning. She mounted a campaign to pressure the Food and Drug Administration into banning the supplement, but her condition deteriorated to the point of total incapacity. In 1976 she was diagnosed with leukemia, and began regular cancer treatment. Allison Hayes died February 26, 1977 at the UCSD Medical Center in La Jolla, California, just short of her 47th birthday. In a letter that arrived after her death, the FDA informed her of amendments being made to the laws governing the importation of nutritional supplements, largely as a result of her advocacy.', 'Charleston, West Virginia, U.S.A.', 1, '/6VoMLGGRH1ccl25cyaHJWyMapD0.jpg'),

        (104537, 'John Leslie', '1945-01-25', 'John Leslie Nuzzo (January 25, 1945 – December 5, 2010) was a prolific porn actor who went on to have a long-running career as a producer and director of adult movies. Usually credited under the name John Leslie, he has also worked under a variety of pseudonyms, including John Leslie Dupre, Frederick Watson, and Lenny Lovely.

Beginning with 1973''s ''Sensuous Delights'', Leslie was a performer in almost 300 adult films. He won numerous awards during his days as a performer. He appeared with some of the era''s most noted porn stars, including Seka, Kay Parker, and Annette Haven. His most noteworthy roles were in ''Talk Dirty To Me'' (1980), ''Nothing To Hide'' (1981), and ''Talk Dirty To Me, Part II'' (1982). He was one of the first porn actors to make the transition from performing to directing, beginning with 1987''s ''Nightshift Nurses''. Since then he directed more than 90 adult movies, including ''The Chameleon'' (1989), ''Curse of the Catwoman'' (1992), ''Dog Walker'' (1994), and ''Drop Sex'' (1997), along with the ''Voyeur'', ''Fresh Meat'' and ''Crack Her Jack'' series. He won many awards for his work behind the cameras as well. Though much of his recent work, in keeping with current trends in adult video, has been in the gonzo genre, such as the ''Fresh Meat'' and ''Crack Her Jack'' series, Leslie has continued to make feature films, or ''sex dramas''; most recently, in 2007 he directed the film ''Brianna Love, Her Fine, Sexy Self''.

In the early 1970s, he was a vocalist and harmonica player for the ''The Brooklyn Blues Busters'', a southeastern Michigan-based musical group sometimes accompanying John Lee Hooker. ''The Brooklyn Blues Busters'' were the backing band for Victoria Spivey during the 1973 Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival. Nuzzo also worked as a bartender in the early 1970s at Mr. Flood''s Party, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was a member of the AVN, Legends of Erotica and XRCO Halls of Fame. John Leslie died on December 5, 2010, from a heart attack, at his home in Mill Valley, California at the age of 65.

Rialson was born in Santa Monica, California, won Miss Hermosa Beach aged 18 and worked as a go-go dancer. After appearing in a series of exploitation films (such as Candy Stripe Nurses, Chatterbox, and Summer School Teachers),  Rialson found herself typecast as a sex kitten, and had difficulty  obtaining new roles, although she did work sporadically on television.  Her last role was in the 1978 political thriller Winter Kills.  According to one obituary, "although never reluctant to take her  clothes off, Rialson was always more "cutie" than sleazy, but she became  so notorious for her B-movie work that mainstream directors hesitated  to hire her".She retired from acting to become a wife and mother and died of liver disease on March 31, 2006.', 'Santa Monica - California  USA', 1, '/jIuVB6vYDxKvqMvA2d4aFRm89AD.jpg'),

Lovelock''s the third of four sons and the only artist of the quartet. Ray first became interested in acting while attending college as a teenager. He began as an extra in both movies and TV commercials to make extra money. An acting agent discovered Ray performing in the Roman nightclub the Piper in a rock band with longtime friend and fellow thespian Tomas Milian. This lead to his first role in the spaghetti Western "Djanjo Kill." However, it was Ray''s part in the hugely successful "Bandits in Milan" that really launched his acting career. Lovelock was fine as David, a free-spirited hippie drifter who falls under the seductive spell of three sexy witches in the eerie "Queens of Evil" (besides playing the lead in this picture, Ray also sings the haunting folk theme song. Lovelock has sung the title tracks for many films he''s appeared in throughout the years.) He was likewise excellent as reluctant hero George in the terrific zombie horror cult classic "The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue" and as Mimsy Farmer''s smooth race car driver lover Edgar in the morbid giallo "Autopsy." Ray gave a memorably slimy performance as apathetic criminal gang leader Aldo in the brutal "Terror." More recently Lovelock had a recurring role as surgeon Dr. Hans Rudolf in the Italian TV series "Incantesimo." His wife Gioai is also his agent. They met in 1968 and got married in 1970.

Donna Corcoran, (born September 29, 1942) is a former child actress who appeared in several Hollywood films of the early 1950s. She most notably appeared in several aquatic musicals that featured Esther Williams (playing swimmer Annette Kellerman as a child in one of them),and as a vulnerable girl being victimized by an emotionally disturbed babysitter (played by Marilyn Monroe) in a more serious drama.

After making her last film in 1955, she made a token comeback as a young adult in an episode of the long-running television sit-com My Three Sons (starring Fred MacMurray) in the early 1960s before finally leaving acting altogether.

Corcoran was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, to William "Bill" Corcoran, Sr. (1905–1958) and the former Kathleen McKenney (1917–1972). Several of her siblings were also child stars, including younger sister Noreen Corcoran, who played Kelly Gregg on John Forsythe''s Bachelor Father (CBS, NBC, and ABC). Two younger brothers also went into acting: Kevin Anthony Corcoran, a star of various Walt Disney films and later a director and producer, and Kelly Corcoran (1958–2002), as a child star, appeared in the Barry Sullivan western series The Road West (1966–1968).

Matthew O. McHugh (January 22, 1894 – February 22, 1971) was an American film actor who appeared in more than 200 films between 1931 and 1955, primarily in small cameo parts.

McHugh came from a theatrical family. His parents ran a stock theatre company and, as a young child, he performed on stage. His brother, Frank, who went on to become part of the Warner Bros. stock company in the 1930s and 1940s, and sister Kitty performed an act with him by the time he was fourteen years old, but the family quit the stage around 1930. His brother Ed became an agent in New York.

Matt made his Broadway debut in Elmer Rice''s Street Scene in 1929, along with his brother Ed, and also appeared in Swing Your Lady in 1936.

Despite his actual origins, McHugh usually performed his roles with a Brooklyn accent, and was often cast as characters explicitly from Brooklyn. In Star Spangled Rhythm (1941), his one scene is a protracted monologue during the climactic "Old Glory" sequence, in which McHugh plays a character who literally embodies the spirit of Brooklyn.', 'Connellsville - Pennsylvania - USA', 2, '/96nk9QOAvkyOEvSBEPAEg2tzHOb.jpg'),

Ralph Clanton (September 11, 1914 - December 29, 2002) was an American character actor. Although his name is not familiar to audiences, he did play a significant supporting role in a classic film which is revived regularly. His most often seen performance is as the Comte De Guiche in the 1950 film Cyrano de Bergerac, the first sound version in English of Edmond Rostand''s classic play, and the film for which José Ferrer won his only Academy Award for Best Actor. Besides Ferrer as Cyrano, Clanton was the only holdover from the cast of the 1946 Broadway revival of the play, and would play the role of De Guiche opposite him once more, in a New York City Center production in 1953.

In addition to playing De Guiche in "Cyrano", Clanton was featured in seven different episodes of Alfred Hitchcock''s television show, as well as making several appearances on the Hallmark Hall of Fame. In 1976, he played the role of George Washington in a PBS television production of Sidney Kingsley''s The Patriots, a drama that had itself been produced on the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1963, but without Clanton. He also played the role of Jasper Delaney on the TV soap operas, Another World and its spinoff, Somerset.

He played the role of Mr. Ingram in the sci-fi thriller The 27th Day.

He played guest star roles on numerous television series, including Perry Mason, in addition to appearing on Broadway in the role of Claude Nau in Robert Bolt''s Vivat! Vivat Regina!, as well as in several Shakespeare productions. One of his last roles was a bit part in the hit Dan Aykroyd - Eddie Murphy film Trading Places, in 1983.

In a playbill for the 1946 revival of Cyrano de Bergerac he is listed as a direct descendant of members of the infamous Clanton gang, which took part in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral

Luis DeJesus had been a circus performer, but was actually quite infamous around New York in the Seventies for his role in a stag movie, a charming little ditty entitled The Anal Dwarf (1971). This eight-minute hardcore wonder was a regular attraction in 42nd Street peepshows, especially for people looking for something different. It was probably through this movie that the makers of "Bloodsucking Freaks" discovered DeJesus--"Freaks" director Joel M. Reed also shot porn at the time, though under a different name--but they got more than they bargained for. On the last day of shooting DeJesus and several other members of the cast shocked Reed by staging an orgy; according to Reed, DeJesus "wasn''t short in all departments". DeJesus continued to act in porn way into the 1980s, then tried for a more mainstream career with disappointing results. Typical of Hollywood''s miscasting of dwarf actors, the only roles were in films like Under the Rainbow (1981), a movie about the alleged wild behavior of the Munchkin cast during the filming of Le magicien d''Oz (1939). His last known role was as an Ewok.

DeJesus was often mistaken for Hervé Villechaize

Mary Treen (born Mary Louise Summers, March 27, 1907 – July 20, 1989) was an American film and television actress, a familiar face who brought levity to the screen. A minor actress for much of her career, she managed to secure a plain, unassuming niche for herself in the Hollywood of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.

Early years

She was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of attorney Don. C. Summers and actress Helene Sullivan Summers. In 1908, when Mary Louise was 11 months old, her mother sued her father for divorce on the grounds that he failed to provide for her. Her father died while she was an infant. She was reared in California by her mother and her stepfather, a physician. Treen attended the Westlake School for Girls and a convent where she tried out successfully in school plays.

Career

During her career, Treen was seen in over 40 films. Among her film roles were Tilly, the secretary of the Building and Loan, in It''s a Wonderful Life (1946) and the role of Pat in the drama Kitty Foyle (1940) starring Ginger Rogers.

Her longest-running role was as Hilda, the maid and baby nurse, in 64 episodes from 1962 to 1965 of the NBC and CBS sitcom The Joey Bishop Show. Earlier, in the 1954–1955 season, she was cast in thirty-eight episodes as Emily Dodger on the CBS sitcom Willy.

Death

Treen died of cancer in Newport Beach, California, July 20, 1989. She was 82. Her only survivors were distant cousins. One of her cousins was actor Mort Mills.', 'St. Louis, Missouri, USA', 1, '/RpmccR2BYTJBTJ0wC0H7wvOI8g.jpg'),

His musical education began early, and he started learning classical music theory and piano from the age of three. After exposure to rock music during his teenage years he practiced electric guitar and drums intensely. In the early 1990s he was working as a sound technician and studio drummer, but by the mid-''90s he had begun his career as a singer. He spent a short time in the independent band Cains:Feel before moving on to the visual kei rock band Malice Mizer. With Gackt as vocalist, lyricist, and composer, they rose to fame within the visual kei genre. In 1999 he parted ways with the band and launched his solo career, debuting with the EP Mizérable. He has since released nine studio albums, eight compilation albums, and forty-four singles. He has toured extensively within Japan and also throughout Asia and Europe.

With an illustrious career spanning over 15 years, and forty-three consecutive singles ranked in the top ten of the Oricon music charts, he holds the title of the most successful male soloist in Japanese music history. A hallmark of his productions has been the use of all-encompassing, conceptual, and sometimes abstract themes, "Moon" and "Requiem et Reminiscence", to develop a series of related songs, concerts, movies, books or theatre play. To describe this idea he combined the words visual, live (concert), and alive to form the term "Visualive". It references the evocative and immersive experience he strives to create for his audiences.

In addition to his music career, Gackt has undertaken various film and television acting roles. He wrote and starred in his first cinematic production Moon Child (2003), which screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003, and the Philadelphia Film Festival in 2004. In 2007 he received a TV Navi award for best supporting actor in a drama, for his portrayal of the powerful feudal leader Kenshin Uesugi in NHK''s The Trusted Confidant (2007).

One of Gackt''s most notable performances was as the samurai protagonist Yoshi in the Guy Moshe film Bunraku (2010), where he costarred alongside Josh Hartnett, Woody Harrelson, Ron Perlman and Demi Moore. His depiction of the unnerving eunuch Jo Teigai in NHK''s TV drama Tempest (2011) was brought to movie screens the following year in Gekijouban Tenpesuto 3D (2012). Recently he reprised his role as both Takashi Shiki and Yumeoji (dream prince) from the television drama Akumu chan (2012) in the cinematic release, Akumu Chan the Movie (2014).

Gackt''s numerous voice acting credits include animated films, such as Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker (2012), and video games, with two from the popular Final Fantasy VII series; Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII (2006)and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII (2007) among others.

In his stage play debut Nemuri Kyoshiro Burahikae (2010), Gackt was cast as the leading character. He later expanded his theater credentials by resuming his "Moon" concept and writing, producing, composing and starring in Moon Saga - Yoshitsune Hiden (2012). He has since announced a sequel scheduled to begin in August 2014 entitled Moon Saga - Yoshitsune Hiden - Chapter 2 (2014).', 'Okinawa, Japan', 1, '/isHNJtqjrQDg4E7s959aRtz1YE2.jpg'),

Paul Brinegar (December 19, 1917 – March 27, 1995) was an American character actor best known for his roles in three western series: The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Rawhide, and Lancer.

Brinegar''s first credited appearance in a feature film was in Larceny (1948). From there, he launched a steady film career that slowed considerably in the late 1950s, after he began appearing on television but did not end until 1994, when Brinegar made his final screen appearance, as a stagecoach driver, in the 1994 film version of Maverick.

Brinegar appeared more than 100 times between 1946 and 1994 in western films, often specializing in playing "feisty, grizzled cowboy sidekicks". On television, from 1956 to 1958, he played James H. "Dog" Kelley, the mayor of Dodge City, Kansas, in the ABC/Desilu western series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp starring Hugh O''Brian. Brinegar appeared in that series 33 times as Kelley and in one other episode in another role. In 1959 he played Ludwig, a bartender, in the episode "The Ringer" of the western series The Texan with Rory Calhoun. Brinegar, however, is best remembered as the cattle-drive cook George Washington Wishbone on the CBS series Rawhide from 1959 to 1966. Earlier he had played a similar role, one as the character Tom Jefferson Jeffrey, in the 1958 movie Cattle Empire upon which Rawhide was based.

Brinegar also made two guest appearances on CBS''s Perry Mason. His first appearance on that series, prior to Rawhide, was in 1958. He performed as Tom Sackett in the first-season episode titled "The Case of the Sun Bather''s Diary". His second appearance on Perry Mason was during the series'' ninth and final season. He played Jason Rohan in the 1966 episode "The Case of the Unwelcome Well".

In the 1968-1970 CBS western series Lancer, Brinegar had the role of Jelly Hoskins; and in 1969 he appeared in the western film Charro! starring Elvis Presley. Then, in 1973, he played the barman in Clint Eastwood''s film High Plains Drifter. From 1982 to 1983, returning to television, Brinegar portrayed a humorous cowboy-like character, Lamar Pettybone, during the first season of the ABC series Matt Houston. Later he reprised a revised version of his Rawhide Wishbone character for the 1991 TV movie The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw, in which he delivers a brief monologue that includes about a dozen references to old television western series.', 'Tucumcari, New Mexico, U.S', 1, '/8YOaYazXeGZLRNcYcson7vym4Tr.jpg'),

Michael Dennis Bryant (5 April 1928 – 25 April 2002) was a British stage and television actor.

Bryant attended Battersea Grammar School and after service in the Merchant Navy and Army, he attended drama school and appeared in many productions on the London stage. He made his film debut in 1955. His greatest role was Mathieu in BBC2''s 1970 adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre''s Roads to Freedom trilogy. His guest star appearance as Wing Commander Marsh, who feigns insanity in the ''Tweedledum'' episode of the BBC drama series, Colditz (1972), is still widely remembered.

Bryant was chosen by Orson Welles to play the lead role in The Deep, Welles''s adaptation of the Charles Williams novel Dead Calm. The production frequently ran out of money, and following the death of actor Laurence Harvey in 1973, Welles stopped production and announced the movie - which had been completed except for one special effects shot of a ship exploding - would not be released. (The novel was finally adapted to film in 1989.)

In 1969 Bryant took his love of the stage on a strange trip into the realm of cult films, playing a clever male prostitute who outwits a delusional family of killers in the dark comedy Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny and Girly, an adaptation of a play by Maisie Mosco. Due to poor marketing and a lack of faith in the film by the distributor, the film quickly sank into obscurity even before it could develop a cult following.

One of Bryant''s most memorable performances was in the classic BBC television play The Stone Tape (1972), in which he plays the leader of a team of scientists who investigate ghost sightings in a brooding gothic mansion.

Bryant also had a supporting role as a sadistic psychiatrist in the cult classic black comedy The Ruling Class, with Peter O''Toole and Alastair Sim. He also appeared in Richard Attenborough''s Gandhi (1982) as a British diplomat.

Having played Lenin in the film Nicholas and Alexandria, Bryant would later reprise the role in Robert Bolt''s play State of Revolution (1977). He had previously co-starred in Bolt''s unsuccessful Gentle Jack. The 1977 production of a Bolt play though was significant for featuring the first role he performed at the National Theatre where he was a constant presence for a quarter of a century. Bryant, described by Michael Billington as "rock-solid company man", had earlier performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1964, including the premiere production of Harold Pinter''s The Homecoming (1965), in which he played Teddy, the returning academic.

In 1980, Michael Bryant won the London Drama Critics Circle Theatre Award for Best Actor, and his other theatrical performances were equally well thought of. Bryant won Laurence Olivier Awards in 1988 and 1990 and was nominated twice more.

Pyke was born Monty Pike in Los Angeles, California, the son of vaudevillian David Pike and his wife Pauline. Pyke majored in theatre at UCLA in the 1960s, appearing in numerous student films, including one for Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, called Induction (1965), which also featured The Doors vocalist Jim Morrison in a brief role. During that time period, Pyke was also associated with Del Close.

From UCLA, Pyke went on to have a long career playing strange, often comic characters in usually out-of-the-ordinary, low-budget, independent features, with some brief appearances in mainstream films. Some of his mainstream appearances, like a small part in the John Milius film Dillinger (1973), ended up cut out of the final film. Although many of his better known films are in the horror genre, Pyke acted in everything from blaxploitation to musical comedies. He had a uniquely manic acting style, with a penchant for physical, exaggerated comedy, marked by a distinctive, raspy voice.

In the 1970s, Pyke''s physical appearance was equally distinctive. Very short, slightly overweight, with a moustache and heavily balding head of wild black hair, he resembled the archetypal Mexican bandit of B-westerns or Sancho Panza (a role he played in The Erotic Adventures Of Don Quixote, 1976). Besides his film work, Pyke acted in theater, musical revues, etc.

During the 1970s, Pyke delivered a number of bizarre performances in off-beat films. His most memorable role was as a creepy bus driver in the 1975 horror film Lemora: A Child''s Tale Of The Supernatural. Other notable 1970s Pyke appearances were in Dolemite, (1975), The First Nudie Musical, (1976), and in Spawn Of The Slithis, (1978). Pyke played the part of Bebe Rebozo in an unreleased Richard Nixon satire called The Way He Was.

Paul Linke (born May 6, 1948) is an American actor, known for his role as Officer Artie Grossman in CHiPs, a television series about the motorcycle officers of the California Highway Patrol. Linke has worked in film and extensively in television, mostly portraying mild-mannered everyman roles.

Linke was born in New York, New York, the son of Richard O. Linke, a personal manager, producer, and partner of Andy Griffith. During the timeframe of his character on the television series CHiPs, Linke played a similar role as Sheriff Bruce Smith in the cult classic, slasher film parody Motel Hell (1980). He also appeared in the film Parenthood (1989).

His career has included appearances on many well known television series such as, The Waltons, Laverne &amp; Shirley, Happy Days, M*A*S*H, Knots Landing, St. Elsewhere, Quantum Leap and Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.

He appeared in a 1985 episode of Three''s a Crowd, a short-lived television sitcom spinoff of Three''s Company starring John Ritter. Linke later spoke at Ritter''s memorial service.

LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). His accomplishments include three NBA championships, four NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, three NBA Finals MVP Awards, and two Olympic gold medals. James has appeared in fifteen NBA All-Star Games and been named NBA All-Star MVP three times. He won the 2008 NBA scoring title, is the all-time NBA playoffs scoring leader, and is fourth in all-time career points scored. He has been voted onto the All-NBA First Team twelve times and the All-Defensive First Team five times. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

James played basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003 as the first overall draft pick. Named the 2003–04 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league''s premier players; he won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 to sign as a free agent with the Miami Heat. This move was announced in an ESPN special titled The Decision, and is one of the most controversial free agent decisions in American sports history.

James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013. He was named league MVP and NBA Finals MVP in both championship years. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals, delivering the team''s first championship and ending Cleveland''s 52-year professional sports title drought. His teams appeared in the NBA Finals in eight consecutive seasons (from 2011 to 2018). In 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers to sign with the Lakers.

Off the court, James has accumulated additional wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America''s most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials. He has also hosted the ESPY Awards and Saturday Night Live, and appeared in the 2015 film Trainwreck.

During the next two years, she had uncredited  appearances in six more films until she received her first major role in  King of Hockey (1936). Warner Brothers Studios gave significant screen time to Gillis in this movie, in hopes that she would become another Shirley Temple.  Although (like all child stars of the 1930s) she never achieved  Temple''s level of fame, for the next several years Gillis starred in  many films, almost always playing a spoiled, bratty character. She had  two rare sympathetic roles as Becky Thatcher in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938) and as the title character in Little Orphan Annie  (1938). One scene in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer called for her to go  into screaming hysterics when her character was trapped in a cave of  bats, and Gillis delivered in a powerful performance that is probably  the most memorable scene of her film career. As Gillis grew older,  however, her career slowed down, and she left Hollywood in 1947. When  she left Hollywood she married Paul Ziebold and had 2 sons. She then  divorced, relocated to New York City and married Richard Fraser,  a Scottish-born actor (they had a son born in 1958). During the 1950s  and ''60s, Gillis made sporadic television appearances, and in 1959, she  hosted a national telecast presentation of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.  Gillis and her husband moved to England in 1961, and they were living  in London when they heard of a casting call for 2001: A Space Odyssey  (1968) that called for an American actress living in the city. Gillis  auditioned and got the role; it remains her final film to date. Ann moved to Belgium in 1972 where she met and married Belgian René Van Hulst (deceased 1999).  She lived in Belgium from 1972 to 2014 and became a Belgian citizen, devoting much of her time to painting and music, she was an accomplished pianist and harpist.

Johannes Adrianus Maria (Hans) van Tongeren (January 18, 1955, Breda - August 25, 1982, Amsterdam) was a Dutch movie actor, who made his debut in the 1980 Paul Verhoeven movie Spetters.

Van Tongeren was born in Breda and was recommended to Joop van den Ende for the role of "Rien" in Spetters by casting-director Hans Kemna. The character Rien is a talented motocrosser who is paralyzed in an accident and commits suicide. Spetters was a very successful movie and van Tongeren was cast afterwards for several Dutch movies.

In 1982 van Tongeren starred with Peter Gallagher and Daryl Hannah in the American movie Summer Lovers. Van Tongeren had been admitted to mental hospitals several times; according to the Dutch media he identified too much with his roles. On August 25, 1982 he committed suicide, just after having been cast in a film after the novel Van de koele meren des doods ("From the Cool Lakes of Death") by Frederik van Eeden, in which he would have played once more a person committing suicide.

He began appearing in stock theater at the age of seven and eventually ended up at the Essanay Studios as a teenager in Chicago where he found steady work until the studios closed. He then moved to New York City and worked on the stage until he was noticed by Samuel Goldwyn who took him to Hollywood. Over the next two decades, he appeared in films and made the transition to sound films.

In 1927, he married Hungarian actress Vilma Bánky in a lavish and highly publicized wedding. They were married until his death in 1969. He retired from movies in 1941 and became a real estate broker.

Marguerite Chapman (March 9, 1918 — August 31, 1999) was an American actress.

Born in Chatham, New York, she was working as a telephone switchboard operator in White Plains, New York when her good looks brought about the opportunity to pursue a career in modeling. Signed by the prestigious John Robert Powers Agency in New York City, the publicity she earned modeling brought an offer from 20th Century Fox film studios in Hollywood.

She made her film debut in 1940, working for the next two years in small roles. In 1942, her big break came with Republic Pictures when she was cast in the leading female role in the twelve-part adventure film serial Spy Smasher, a production that is considered by many as one of the best serials ever made. As a result, Chapman soon began receiving offers for more leading roles and appeared opposite important stars such as Edward G. Robinson and George Sanders. With America''s entry in World War II, she entertained the troops, worked for the War bond drive and at the Hollywood Canteen.

During the 1950s Chapman continued to perform mostly in secondary film roles, notably in Marilyn Monroe''s 1955 hit The Seven Year Itch. However, with the advent of television she kept busy into the early 1960s with guest appearances in a number different shows including Rawhide, Perry Mason, and Four Star Playhouse.

Chapman was reportedly initially selected to play the role of "Old Rose" Dawson-Calvert in the 1997 James Cameron epic Titanic but poor health prevented her from accepting the offer.[citation needed]

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Marguerite Chapman has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6290 Hollywood Blvd.

Marguerite Chapman died in 1999, aged 81, and was interred in Holy Cross Cemetery, in Culver City, California

William A. Seiter (June 10, 1890 - July 26, 1964) was an American film director. He was born in New York City. After attending Hudson River Military Academy, Seiter broke into films in 1915 as a bit player at Mack Sennett''s Keystone Studios, doubling a cowboy. He graduated to director in 1918.

At Universal Studios in the mid-1920s, Seiter was principal director of the popular Reginald Denny vehicles, most of which co-starred Seiter''s then wife Laura La Plante (his second wife was actress Marian Nixon). This period also included The Beautiful and Damned and The Family Secret.

In the early talkie era, Seiter helped nurture the talents of RKO''s comedy duo Wheeler &amp; Woolsey in such rollicking features as Caught Plastered (1931) and Diplomaniacs (1933). He also directed the Laurel and Hardy feature Sons of the Desert (1933), their only film together. Other films include Sunny, Going Wild, Kiss Me Again, Hot Saturday, Way Back Home, Girl Crazy, Rafter Romance, Roberta, Room Service, Susannah of the Mounties, Allegheny Uprising, You Were Never Lovelier, Up in Central Park, One Touch of Venus.

Among the many stars directed by Seiter during his long career were Shirley Temple, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Henry Fonda, Margaret Sullavan, Jack Haley, Deanna Durbin, Jean Arthur, John Wayne, Fred MacMurray, Lucille Ball, Rita Hayworth and the Marx Brothers.

While many of his films were minor gems, Seiter was capable of turning out bad movies once in a while. For example, if he ran into friction from his star—as was the case with Lou Costello in 1946''s Little Giant -- Seiter would get even by adhering religiously to the script, refusing to add any nuance or creativity to the project (this pettiness may have been the reason that one prominent actress of the 1930s referred to Seiter as the most unimaginative director she''d ever worked with). On his final four films, before he retired in 1954, Seiter functioned as both producer and director. These films included The Lady Wants Mink (1953), a gentle satire of the then topical "raise your own coat" craze.

Randy Stuart, born as Elizabeth Shaubell (October 24, 1924 – July 20, 1996), was an American actress in film and television. A familiar face in several popular films of the 1940s and 1950s, and later in Western-themed television series, she is perhaps best remembered as Louise Carey, the wife of Scott Carey, played by Grant Williams, in The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957), a science-fiction classic named in 2009 as “culturally, historically or aesthetically” significant to be preserved for all time in the Library of Congress''s National Film Registry.

A screen test in the play The Women led to Stuart being placed under contract at 20th Century Fox. Her film debut was uncredited in the 1947 picture, The Foxes of Harrow. Stuart plays the birth mother of main character Stephen Fox, in the film''s initial scene.

In 1948, she played Peggy, a knowing secretary (and collaborator with star Clifton Webb) in the comedy Sitting Pretty. She also appeared that year (sixth-billed) as the wife of a returning veteran in Apartment for Peggy with William Holden and Jeanne Crain.

In 1949, she portrayed Lieutenant Eloise Billings, an object of desire for Cary Grant, in the Howard Hawks film I Was a Male War Bride, also starring Ann Sheridan. That same year, she appeared opposite Jose Ferrer in Otto Preminger''s psychological noir, Whirlpool. Stuart was billed on posters as a supporting player in the comedy / musical Dancing in the Dark, starring William Powell and Betsy Drake.

In 1950, Stuart was briefly in that year''s Best Picture, All About Eve, as a telephone friend of Anne Baxter. She had fourth billing in the noir comedy Stella, with Ann Sheridan and Victor Mature.

In 1951, she appeared as Marge Boyd in I Can Get It For You Wholesale, in what might have been her breakout role. In 1952, Stuart teamed again with Grant and Drake in the comedy Room for One More for Warner Bros.

After 1957''s Incredible Shrinking Man, she was cast as Nancy Dawson in the 1958 western film, Man from God''s Country, starring George Montgomery.

Noel Ferrier AM (20 December 1930 in Melbourne – 16 October 1997 in Sydney) was an Australian television personality, stage and film actor, raconteur and theatrical producer. Ferrier had an extensive Australian theatre career which spanned over fifty years.  A member of the first Australian professional repertory company, the Union Theatre Repertory Company, he created the role of ''Roo'' in the original production of Summer of the Seventeenth Doll at the Union Theatre of the University of Melbourne. He appeared in numerous films and television productions. A contemporary of Barry Humphries, in 1956 he was the "interviewer" of the first onstage appearance of a certain Mrs. Norm Everidge, later known universally as Dame Edna.  

To ease the workload on Graham Kennedy, he was invited by GTV9 to host a Friday night version of In Melbourne Tonight from 1963 to 1965. This was stylistically different to that of Kennedy''s IMT, – "dyed in the wool IMT viewers switched off in their droves"  – Noel Ferrier''s In Melbourne Tonight (as it was known) garnered a separate and loyal audience, resulting in a Logie for Most Popular Program in Victoria in 1964.  . Following this success, the network decided to relay the show in Sydney on TCN9, but in the early hours of the following morning after live telecasts of World Championship Wrestling .

After his period on IMT finished in 1965, he started a morning radio show in Melbourne on 3UZ with Mary Hardy called "The Noel and Mary Show", which contained a riotously funny serial known as "The House on the Hill" featuring Sir &amp; Lady Ernest Snatchbull, "set in a mythical Government House and loosely based on the vice-regal column in The Age... the real Governor of Victoria of the time was a (reputedly) devoted fan... whereas his wife was said to have abhorred it."  

He developed a reputation as a reliable television character actor; appearances occurred in Riptide (1969), Skippy (1970), as well as a numerous characters in the Crawfords stable of productions, including Homicide (1969), Division 4 (1970, 1971 &amp; 1975), and Matlock Police (1973,1974 &amp; 1975). In 1971 he won the award for Best Australian Comedy with Noel Ferrier''s ''Australia A-Z.  He was a regular panelist in Graham Kennedy''s popular game show Blankety Blanks.  His movie credits include Alvin Purple, Eliza Fraser, Turkey Shoot and The Year of Living Dangerously. His final movie role was in Paradise Road.

Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American politician who became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, when he won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Politics and gay activism were not his early interests; he was not open about his homosexuality and did not participate in civic matters until around the age of 40, after his experiences in the counterculture of the 1960s.

Milk moved from New York City to settle in San Francisco in 1972 amid a migration of gay men to the Castro District. He took advantage of the growing political and economic power of the neighborhood to promote his interests, and ran unsuccessfully for political office three times. His theatrical campaigns earned him increasing popularity, and Milk won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977, part of the broader social changes the city was experiencing.

Milk served 11 months in office and was responsible for passing a stringent gay rights ordinance for the city. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, another city supervisor who had recently resigned but wanted his job back. Milk''s election was made possible by and was a key component of a shift in San Francisco politics. The assassinations and the ensuing events were the result of continuing ideological conflicts in the city.

Despite his short career in politics, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and "a martyr for gay rights", according to University of San Francisco professor Peter Novak. In 2002, Milk was called "the most famous and most significantly open LGBT official ever elected in the United States". Anne Kronenberg, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: "What set Harvey apart from you or me was that he was a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us." Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.

This led to an audition for the London production of The Sound of Music at the Palace Theatre where she played the parts of Brigitta and Louisa for three years. She then became a student at the Corona Stage School in Hammersmith, West London.

At sixteen, she still played children''s roles, as she appeared young for her age; the start of her television career was in Z-Cars with Malcolm McDowell. A theatre tour of Counter Crime followed and the musical tour of The Roar of the Greasepaint—the Smell of the Crowd starring Norman Wisdom and Willoughby Goddard, written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, playing one of the urchins with Elaine Paige and choreography by Gillian Lynne. Sheila White''s big break came playing the part of Eileen in the musical On The Level at the Saville Theatre. She was taken out of the chorus and the song "Bleep – Bleep", was written especially for her. This song proved to be a show-stopper, making Sheila White''s name in the West End theatre.

Jerome Benton (born September 19, 1962) is an American musical performer, backup dancer and comedic actor. He can be seen in music videos by Janet Jackson and Prince, but he is best known for his association with The Time.

Benton is the half brother of Time bassist Terry Lewis and worked closely with the band behind the scenes in its initial stages. During one performance, lead singer Morris Day asked for someone to bring him a mirror. Benton responded by ripping a mirror out of the club''s restroom and bringing it on stage for Day to comb his hair. This act elevated Benton''s integration into the band as a comic foil to Day, along with his dancing and providing backing vocals. In 1983, when Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis missed a concert in San Antonio, Benton was tasked by Prince to pretend to fill in for Lewis on stage with his bass unplugged, while Prince provided the bass line backstage. Jam and Lewis were eventually fired after the tour.

Benton appeared in the 1984 film Purple Rain with the rest of The Time and assumed the role of Morris Day''s bodyguard and valet. He also appeared in Prince''s second film Under the Cherry Moon. The chemistry between Day and Benton was well-received. Although The Time soon dissolved after Day started pursuing a solo career, Prince retained Benton, as well as Jellybean Johnson and Paul Peterson for the short-lived project The Family.

Benton reunited with his other group, The Family, on December 13, 2003 for a single charity performance along with other acts formerly associated with Prince. According to a January 31, 2007 press release on St. Paul''s website, The Family announced that the group is returning with a new record and a tour.

Mandy-Rae Cruickshank (born May 10, 1974, in Canada) is a world champion free-diver and record-holder from Vancouver, British Columbia.

Cruickshank holds several Canadian and world records. She set the women''s world record for constant ballast by diving to a depth of 88 metres (289 ft) on one breath, in April 2007 in the Cayman Islands. On April 8, 2005, Cruickshank set the new world record in the Constant Weight without fins discipline, free-diving to 50m. On April 11, 2005, she set the new world record in the Free Immersion discipline, diving to 74m by pulling herself down and up a line.

As captain of the Canadian free-diving team at the 2004 AIDA World Freediving Championships, the women''s team (consisting of Cruickshank and teammates Jade Leutenegger and Jessica Apedaile) took first place.

In May 2006 she was the subject of media attention as one of stage magician David Blaine''s Drowned Alive show safety divers (as a member of the Performance Freediving Team). Along with Martin Štěpánek she dove into Blaine''s water-filled sphere to rescue him from drowning during his failed 9-minute breath-holding stunt.

She was also cast in the 2009 documentary film The Cove.

In 1970 he founded the Dolphin Project, a group that aims to educate the public about captivity and, where feasible, free captive dolphins . He was featured in the Academy Award-winning film, The Cove (2009), which used covert techniques to expose the yearly dolphin drive hunting that goes on in Taiji, Japan.

Arthur Morton Godfrey (August 31, 1903 – March 16, 1983) was an American radio and television broadcaster and entertainer who was sometimes introduced by his nickname, "The Old Redhead". No television personality of the 1950s enjoyed more clout or fame than Godfrey until an on-camera incident undermined his folksy image and triggered a gradual decline; the then-ubiquitous Godfrey helmed two CBS-TV weekly series and a daily 90-minute television mid-morning show through most of the decade but by the early 1960s found himself reduced to hosting an occasional TV special.

Arguably the most prominent of the medium''s early master commercial pitchmen, he was strongly identified with many of his many sponsors, especially Chesterfield cigarettes and Lipton Tea. After many years for Chesterfield (during which Godfrey came up with the idea and slogan "Buy ''em by the carton"), he severed the relationship during one of his television programs, when his doctors convinced him that his lung cancer was due to smoking. Subsequently, he became a prominent spokesman for anti-smoking education.
