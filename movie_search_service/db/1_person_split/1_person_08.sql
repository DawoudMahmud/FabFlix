His father is Sicilian and his mother is Anglo-Irish. He has a younger sister called Claudia Marissa, born in 1992.  Prior to winning the Hollyoaks role, he was a student, starting in February 2007, at the Manchester School of Acting. At the same time as filming for Hollyoaks, he was also playing Cam Spencer in web series LOL, which explores sex, drugs and relationships.

Mirallegro appeared in a short film by Plato Films and All-Seeing Eye Productions, called Six Minutes of Freedom, in July 2009, between filming for Hollyoaks. Mirallegro stars as a troubled teenager called Chris who is training to be a boxer. His sister Claudia also makes an appearance. This film was entered into four film festivals.

Six Minutes of Freedom was released for download at Mi Shorts on January 12, 2011, following a successful festival run in the summer of 2010.

On 10 November 2010, Mirallegro appeared as a gay character called Jamie, who suffers bullying (because of his sexuality) in an episode of series 2 of the BBC drama series Moving On. The episode is called "Losing My Religion".

Mirallegro recently appeared as a guest in nine episodes of the regular BBC series Doctors; this was announced on 7 June 2010 in an article by Digital Spy. He appeared in the role of Italian foreign exchange student Giovanni Mannasorri, who arrived in Letherbridge to study at university. His first episode in this role was shown on 24 September.

He finished filming for his role in McQueen the Movie by Bitter Sweet Pictures in the summer of 2010. He played Sam, a young Jewish lad (one of the two main protagonists of the story: Sam and Nick). The film is set in suburbia in the North of England in the 1990s.

From 26 to 28 December 2010, Mirallegro appeared in series 1 of BBC1 1930s period remake of Upstairs Downstairs. He played a young footman called Johnny Proude, who took up a position in service to escape the poverty of the northern mining town where he was born. In the first episode, Proude got into trouble with the police within his first week of service at 165 Eaton Place, and was sent away to a borstal, but returned in the third episode.

On 10 February 2011, the BBC Press Office announced that the series has been re-commissioned for a further six episodes, which would be shown in 2012.

In May 2011, Mirallegro appeared in the BBC''s 3-part psychological thriller Exile, playing the teenage version of leading character Tom Ronstadt (played by John Simm). Later that same year, Mirallegro played the role of Sam, a gay heroin addict in the BBC drama The Body Farm.  From Sunday 19 February to Sunday 25 March 2012, Mirallegro appeared again as Johnny Proude in Series 2 of BBC''s remake of Upstairs Downstairs.[10] The episode which featured Mirallegro''s character the most was "All The Things You Are"; which showed Johnny Proude in training to take part in a boxing competition, and gave some hint of his fears about becoming a soldier in World War II.

Mirallegro completed filming in a new film about The Stone Roses called Spike Island, which was released in November 2012.

A student of David Johnson who is arguably Britain''s most successful independent acting tutor considers David a versatile passionate and dedicated professional. David Lemberg is a master of Eastern European, Irish and American accents as well as native regional English accents and is known for his thoroughly researched and well executed emotional character work. David Lemberg was born in Manchester, England, the son of a former Soviet Soldier who escaped the tyrannies of Stalinism during World War II. David achieved a BA Honours degree in Fine Art at Chelsea School of Art well known for its output of acclaimed actors and directors and his career path eventually changed from painting to drama.

After returning home as a penniless artist from Kiev to England he had an opportunistic meeting with Robert Carlyle in a Manchester bar; David managed to convince the barman that he and Robert needed a few after hour drinks to further their discussions. The bar man refused at first but didn''t seem to argue after some careful persuasion, whatever it was his acting career definitely sparked off that evening and he''s never looked backed since.

TV credits include frequent appearances in sketches on Jimmy Kimmel Live! as well as episodes of "Raising Hope" on Fox, "Elementary" on CBS, and HBO''s "Bored to Death". Recent film credits include "The Longest Week" opposite Jason Bateman and "Excuse Me for Living" opposite Wayne Knight. He has also appeared in many national and regional commercials and print campaigns including those for Nexium, Apple, Cablevision, British Airways and Post Cereal.

As a comic, he appears at comedy clubs, theaters and other venues around the country and is a regular at the Broadway Comedy Club and Dangerfield''s in NYC. His comedy has been described by "Back Stage" as "edgy, observant and funny . . . the sort of brainy observations you wish you''d thought of . . . ." When in Los Angeles, he performs long form improv around town with his team The Jaywalkers.

A New York native, Eric is a former corporate attorney having "practiced" at one of New York''s oldest and most venerated, and now defunct, white-shoe law firms. Though that firm''s demise was not really his fault, ask him for legal advice at your own peril. A hockey fanatic, he once dreamed of playing in the NHL, but realized his lack of size and skill might be a hindrance. Nonetheless, he still enjoys mixing it up on the ice regularly and once scored a goal on a one-timer off a pass from Academy Award winning actor Tim Robbins.

Betty Ross Clarke (born May Clarke, May 1, 1892 – January 24, 1970) was an American stage and film actress. She appeared in more than 30 films between 1920 and 1940, including silent and sound films, in both credited and uncredited roles.

During the 1920s, Clarke appeared in 14 silent films, including 11 U.S. films, two British films and one German film. In the United States, she worked for film companies that included Famous Players-Lasky, Thomas H. Ince, and Vitagraph Studios. She played the female lead in the film If I Were King opposite William Farnum and had other starring roles in silent films.

Clarke''s first screen role in a "talkie" was as the character Dot Aldrich in The Age for Love. During the 1930s, she appeared in more than 20 sound films, including both feature films and short films. She typically played character roles, both credited and uncredited. Of note, she replaced the actress Sara Haden as Aunt Millie in two feature length Andy Hardy films. Betty Ross Clarke was occasionally billed in screen credits as "Betsy Ross Clarke" or "Betty Ross Clark," and her name appears as "Betty Ross-Clarke" in some databases, such as the Internet Broadway Database.

Throughout her career, Clarke often performed on both the theater stage and in films during the same time period. A newspaper advertisement in 1922 noted that audience members could "see her on stage and screen at the same time," because she was performing in the play The Morning Him and also starring in the film At the Sign of the Jack O''Lantern. Commenting on the difference between stage and film acting, Clarke remarked that the "silent drama affords an easier life to those who choose it, for one has the nights free, to do as one likes. On the boards an actor''s or actresses''s time is always taken up."

Most of the silent films in which Clarke appeared have not survived. However, the films If I Were King and Mother o'' Mine are preserved in the silent film archive of the Library of Congress. A print of Mother o'' Mine is also housed in the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The silent film Traveling Salesman, with Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle in the leading role, can be found in the George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection in Rochester, New York. Many of the later sound films in which she appeared are still available, including Murders in the Rue Morgue, A Bride for Henry, Love Finds Andy Hardy, Judge Hardy''s Children, and Four Wives.', 'Langdon, North Dakota, USA', 1, '/aL4pxDGseJKqK60Djng5PfqPmcz.jpg'),

Frederick Tyrone Edmond Power (2 May 1869 – 23 December 1931) was an English stage and screen actor, who acted under the name Tyrone Power.

After an extremely prosperous 30 years of acting on the stage and touring around the world, Power moved into silent films in 1914. Initially playing the leading man in films, he soon switched to playing villains and proved highly successful.

In 1916 Power played the male lead in Where Are My Children?, a serious film about birth control and social issues directed by pioneer woman director Lois Weber and her husband Phillips Smalley. That same year Power appeared in a Selig film called John Needham''s Double. When not acting on Broadway, Power appeared in films. Producer William Fox found him a great character part at Fox Studios in Footfalls (1921). Also in 1921 Power appeared in D.W. Griffith''s Dream Street in which experimental synchronised sound was used, using the Photokinema sound-on-disc system. In 1924 Power was in the cast of the sumptuous Janice Meredith, a Hearst produced Marion Davies vehicle. In 1925 Power appeared in a film called The Red Kimono, a film as daring as Where Are My Children? had been a decade earlier. The Red Kimono was produced and partly written by Dorothy Davenport, the widow of Wallace Reid. Power finished out the decade and silent era in several A-list silent films.

In 1930, Power had a final great role as the villainous "bull whacker" Red Flack in Raoul Walsh''s widescreen epic The Big Trail, which was Power''s first and only talkie and provided an unknown John Wayne with his first starring role. Power then prepared to film a sound remake of The Miracle Man, which had been a great silent success in 1919 for Lon Chaney. A few scenes had been shot, but before filming could be completed Power died of a heart attack in the arms of his 17-year-old son at the end of 1931. He was 62. His part of the preacher in The Miracle Man was taken up by fellow veteran actor Hobart Bosworth.

He is now usually referred to as Tyrone Power Sr., to distinguish him from his son, star actor Tyrone Power, who would die at the age of 44, also of a heart attack .', 'London, England, UK', 1, '/uxp1JLdtybgPsLgum0PiVdwu2oS.jpg'),

Atlanta was the final stop on the news circuit, where she worked as the morning reporter for CBS46''s Good Morning Atlanta. While in the news biz Stacey earned an Emmy nomination, two Society of Professional Journalists Green Eyeshade Awards, and was selected as a favorite television personality by a local Texas magazine.

Her first acting role was in a church play at the age of 6. For Stacey, being from a small town on the outskirts of Atlanta was about as far from Hollywood as a girl could be. It wouldn''t be until many years later, doing a play while working as a reporter in Savannah, that the interest would be re-sparked. Stacey decided to leave a career in the news industry to pursue acting full time. It wasn''t long before she landed a small role in the film The Blind Side (2009) starring Sandra Bullock. While in Atlanta she also booked roles on The Army Wives and Drop Dead Diva. Shortly after that Stacey moved to Los Angeles to continue her career. Since her move she has had the opportunity to work on several films with directors such as Sophia Coppola, The Bling Ring (2013), Phil Joanou, The Veil (2015) and Jonathan Liebesman, Battle: Los Angeles (2011). She has also worked on top rated television shows including Bones, Scandal, Graceland and Legends.

Fondateur du fascisme, il est président du Conseil du Royaume d''Italie, du 31 octobre 1922 au 25 juillet 1943, premier maréchal d''Empire du 30 mars 1938 au 25 juillet 1943, et président de laRépublique sociale italienne (RSI) de septembre 1943 à avril 1945. Il est couramment désigné du titre de Duce, mot italien dérivé du latin Dux et signifiant « Chef » ou « Guide ».  Il est d''abord membre du Parti socialiste italien (PSI) et directeur du quotidien socialiste Avanti! à partir de 1912. Anti-interventionniste convaincu avant la Première Guerre mondiale, il change d''opinion en 1914, se déclarant favorable à l''entrée en guerre de l''Italie. Expulsé du PSI en novembre 1914, il crée son propre journal, Il Popolo d''Italia (Le peuple d''Italie) qui prend des positions nationalistes proches de celles de la petite bourgeoisie. Dans l''immédiat après-guerre, profitant du mécontentement de la « victoire mutilée », il crée le Parti national fasciste (PNF) en 1921 et se présente au pays avec un programme politique nationaliste, autoritaire, antisocialiste et antisyndical, ce qui lui vaut l''appui de la petite bourgeoisie et d''une partie des classes moyennes industrielles et agraires.  Dans le contexte de forte instabilité politique et sociale qui suit la Grande Guerre, il vise la prise du pouvoir, en forçant la main aux institutions avec l''aide des actions de squadristi et l''intimidation qui culminent le 28 octobre 1922 avec la Marche sur Rome. Mussolini obtient la charge de constituer le gouvernement le 30 octobre 1922. En 1924, après la victoire contestée des élections et l''assassinat du député socialiste Giacomo Matteotti, Mussolini assume l''entière responsabilité de la situation. La série des « Lois fascistissimes » lui attribue des pouvoirs dictatoriaux et fait de l''Italie un régime à parti unique.  Après 1935, il se rapproche du régime nazi d''Adolf Hitler avec qui il établit le Pacte d''Acier (1939). Convaincu d''un conflit à l''issue rapide, il entre dans la Seconde Guerre mondiale au côté de l''Allemagne nazie. Les défaites militaires de l''Italie et le débarquement des Alliés sur le sol italien entraînent sa mise en minorité par le Grand Conseil du fascisme le 24 juillet 1943 : il est alors destitué et arrêté par ordre du roi. Libéré par les Allemands, il instaure en Italie septentrionale la République sociale italienne.

Fortunately for audiences and filmmakers alike, the phase hasn''t passed, as since that time, Cambell has had the pleasure of working with such acclaimed directors as Richard Linklater (on Boyhood), Kimberly Peirce (on Stop Loss), and Robert Rodriguez (on Shorts), as well as emerging filmmakers like Bryan Ortiz (on The Big Scary German and DR. S The Movie), Carl Theil (on Drawing Closer, the Grammy nominated music producer and noted film composer''s directorial debut) and award-winning filmmaker at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, Pablo Veliz (on The Boys of Ghost Town).

Cambell''s credits also include commercial campaigns for Wal-Mart and Sears, a pilot for MTV, and several theatre credits. When he is not on stage or on screen, Cambell can be found on the field playing football, baseball, or soccer.

Chhabra graduated from Delhi University with an acting diploma from the Shri Ram Centre for Performing Arts. He completed a six-year acting and teaching stint with the ‘Theatre in Education’ Company (TIE) affiliated with the National School of Drama.(NSD)

Chhabra came to Mumbai in 2007 and worked as an Assistant Casting Director before setting up his own casting company. His first film as independent casting director was the small budget film Chintuji. His casting for the film Chillar Party won him accolades based on which director Anurag Kashyap engaged him for the casting of his crime thriller Gangs of Wasseypur and also its sequel.

Subsequently, Chhabra did the casting for films of different genres like Kai Po Che, Shahid, Chennai Express, Jai Ho, Hasee To Phasee, Mastram and D-day. Apart from films, he''s also done casting for TVCs. In his career, Chhabra has employed several unconventional casting methods.

Steve Borden (born March 20, 1959), better known by his ring name Sting, is an American retired professional wrestler, signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in an ambassador role. He is best known for his time spent with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Sting is a 15-time world heavyweight champion, having held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship twice, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship seven times, the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship twice, the TNA World Heavyweight Championship four times and the WWA World Heavyweight Championship once. He is a WCW Triple Crown winner, has held 21 total championships between WCW and TNA, and is the only man to hold the NWA, WCW, and TNA World Titles in his career. In 2002, after over a year and a half of hiatus, Borden toured Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion throughout November and December. His first match in the WWA took place on November 28, 2002, in Dublin, Ireland, where he reunited with Lex Luger to defeat Buff Bagwell and Malice. At The Retribution on December 6, 2002 in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, Sting lost to Luger in a bout for the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Luger to claim the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in Zurich, Switzerland, on December 13

Despite negotiations, Borden until the end of his career never signed a contract with WWE. His only live appearance on a television program owned by the organization until 2014 occurred on the final edition of WCW Monday Nitro in March 2001; he subsequently appeared in WWE media only through archive materials acquired by the promotion upon its purchase of WCW. Owing to his loyalty to the now-defunct promotion, Sting came to be known as "The Franchise of WCW" during the 1990s. WWE has named Sting the greatest superstar in WCW history, and described him as "one of the most popular and respected competitors of all time." After WCW''s closing Sting signed with TNA where he was announced as the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame in June 2012. Pro Wrestling Illustrated readers voted Borden "Most Popular Wrestler of the Year" a record four times. Borden made his debut in WWE at Survivor Series 2014, and was inducted into WWE''s Hall of Fame in 2016.  Borden was an admitted anabolic steroid user in the 1980s. He became a born-again Christian in August 1998, after confessing his adultery, and substance and alcohol abuse to his then-wife. Borden has two sons, Garrett Lee and Steve, Jr. and a daughter named Gracie, who was born in 2000. His elder son Garrett attends Azusa Pacific University, where he plays college football as a running back. Steven attended Kilgore College, where he played tight end; on December 19, 2012, he committed to attend the University of Kentucky.  After the 2015 NFL Draft, Steven was invited by the Kansas City Chiefs to try out for the team at their rookie mini-camp.

Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ( listen); born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club FC Barcelona and captains the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only football player in history to win five FIFA Ballons d''Or, four of which he won consecutively, and the first player to win three European Golden Shoes.[note 2] With Barcelona he has won eight La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles, as well as four Copas del Rey. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals scored in La Liga, a La Liga season (50), and a football season (82), as well as those for most assists made in La Liga and the Copa América. He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country.

Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona''s youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d''Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d''Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.', 'Rosario, Argentina', 1, '/yIN0zK9yM92Uz9AcQJsQAcNlLps.jpg'),

In 1960, Morton met Lucille Ball in New York City a few months before she opened on Broadway in the musical Wildcat. Morton claimed he was always busy working nights, so had not seen the beloved series I Love Lucy. They were married on November 19, 1961 at the Marble Collegiate Church in New York City. Morton signed a prenuptial agreement to stifle rumors that he was a gold digger. Morton was 13 years younger than Lucille Ball.

Born and raised in Southern California, the straight-A honors student has balanced acting and academics, having a normal childhood while still finding time to pursue his childhood dreams. 

  In Bailey''s very first role, Carrie Ann Inaba (judge on Dancing with the Stars) saw something special when she cast Bailey for a lead role in the independent film that she directed and produced. One film role led to over twenty others, in which Bailey worked with Larry David (Curb Your Enthusiasm), Jason Segel (How I Met Your Mother), Michael Rapaport, Charlie McDowell, and Marisa Tomei, among others.  

  Nominated for a Young Artist Award for best supporting actor for his role in the film Good Time Max, director James Franco hand picked Bailey to play the young version of himself in the film - a twelve year old genius with a rebellious streak.  

  Bailey has visited 27 countries with his family, traveling throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia - Dubai being his favorite.  

  Now in high school, Bailey continues to seek roles that challenge him as an actor, while taking AP classes and working towards graduating from high school his sophomore year. He hopes to continue acting while he studies screenwriting and film in college, and eventually wants to write, act, and direct.

  Has an older brother called James.

  Attended Alleyn Court School in Southend, England from the age of 3 to 7.

  Studied ballet, modern, jazz and tap with Miss Vanda Morgan at her Performing Arts Academy from the age of 4.

  Attends the ''Sylvia Young Theatre School'' full time in London and is one of the youngest students ever to do so.

  Loves Facebook and keeps in close contact with all her old school, theatre, TV &amp; film friends.

  Was not seen the first time for the open casting of the ''Sound of Music'' as thousands of people turned up but did not give up, had her first call four weeks on. Six recalls later she was given the part and then had the honour of the Opening and Press night of Andrew Lloyd Webber''s new West End show.

  Has been in Hello magazine for a feature and photo shoot.

  Got a Blue Peter badge in 2006.

  Most embarrassing moment, swallowing her tooth on stage in the ''Sound of Music'' while singing Edelweiss.

  Favourite theatre show is ''Wicked'' (with Kerry Ellis) but ''Phantom of the Opera'' is a close second. And of course the fantastic ''Les Miserables''.

  Best memorable moments: getting her first acting part and meeting Kerry Ellis, funniest person met: Graham Norton and the scariest moment: The Tower of Terror at Disney MGM.

  Heavily involved with and supports the Cosette Project Charity to help abused and trafficked children.

  Attends the Royal Academy of Dance for Ballet.

Born in Lausanne in 1933 of an Irish father and French mother, Roland attended the Paris Conservatory, and his early work on the Paris stage included the role of Fortinbras in Hamlet, plus several performances for the Comedie-Francaise. From 1951 he played small parts in French films and eventually made his international screen debut in 1956 with a small part in Trapeze in which he doubled for Burt Lancaster. In 1959 he tried his luck in Hollywood, but owing to work permit problems was only given television bit parts in Bonanza, Laramie, The Twilight Zone, U.S. Steel Hour and Thriller. Returning to Europe, he appeared in the television series Tales of the Vikings produced in Munich for Kirk Douglas''s company. This attracted the attention of the Rome studios who were seeking athletic actors to play in historical epics. Since Roland''s CV listed his sporting activities as tennis, horse riding, ice hockey, roller hockey, soccer, American football, skiing, water skiing, swimming, motor racing, sailing, boxing, karate, fencing, cycling, motocross, side-car racing, volleyball, basketball and rafting, it was hardly surprising that Riccardo Freda selected him for the lead part of mythological hero Jason in The Giants of Thessaly (1960). He also starred in Sword of El Cid (1963) and Revolt of the Barbarians (1964). After the epics Roland switched to more artistic parts and cameo roles, and used the pseudonym "Rod Carter" for action movies. Because of his theatrical experience he was also in demand as a voice actor at Fono Roma where he dubbed Italian pictures into French, but he also speaks fluent English, German and Italian. Since 1982 he has been based almost entirely in Switzerland, although he lives near Florence.

Maurice George Costello (February 22, 1877 – October 29,

1950)[1] was an American prominent vaudeville actor of the late 1890s and early

1900s, who later played a principal role in early American films, as both a

leading man, supporting player and a director.

Costello was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Irish

immigrants Ellen and Thomas Costello. He appeared in his first motion picture

in 1905, in which he had the honour of appearing in the first serious film to

feature the character of Sherlock Holmes in the movie Adventures of Sherlock

Holmes, in which Costello played the title role. He continued to work for

Vitagraph, being a member of the first motion picture stock company ever

formed, playing opposite Florence Turner. Among some of his best known pictures

are A Tale of Two Cities, The Man Who Couldn''t Beat God and For the Honor of

the Family. After an absence of some years he returned to the screen. He was

married to actress Mae Costello (née Altschuk). His descendants include two

daughters, actresses Dolores Costello and Helene Costello, a grandson John Drew

Barrymore, and a great granddaughter Drew Barrymore. He was one of the world''s

first leading men in early American cinema, but like a lot of other silent

screen stars, he found the transition to "talkies" extremely

difficult, and his leading man status was over. However, Costello was a

trouper, and continued to appear in movies, often in small roles and bit parts,

right up until his death in 1950.', 'Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA', 1, '/yMalNKqJyPiXtCY4hEkYYG5Y2AP.jpg'),

Marilyn Harris (July 17, 1924 – December 1, 1999) was an American child actress who appeared in several Hollywood productions in the 1930s and 1940s. She is best remembered for her role as "Little Maria" in the 1931 horror film Frankenstein.  Harris was born in San Fernando, California and placed in a Los Angeles orphanage shortly after her birth. She was adopted by an area couple when she was a month old. Shortly after her adoption, she appeared in a Rin Tin Tin film. In her later years, Harris revealed that her adoptive mother forced her to pursue a screen career because of her own failed attempts to become an actress. Harris also claimed that her mother was physically and emotionally abusive.

In 1931, Harris won the role of "Little Maria" in the horror film Frankenstein. In arguably the film''s most memorable scene, Maria meets the fugitive monster (played by Boris Karloff) beside a lakeside and charms the monster with her innocence, humanity and friendship, something which he had not experienced with previously hostile, mistrusting adults. A children''s game is however tragically misinterpreted by the monster, and he ends up throwing Little Maria into the lake, unintentionally drowning her and turning the surrounding village''s population into a lynch mob, baying for revenge after the child''s body is found. The shot of Maria being thrown into the water was cut from original prints and only restored in the 1980s.

After appearing in Frankenstein, Harris continued her career in small roles in films. She left acting at the age of 19 shortly after marrying Wally Watkins, a bouncer she met while working as a cashier at the Hollywood Palladium. The couple had a son the following year. After Harris'' husband died in 1981, she remarried. Harris'' second husband, Carl, died in 1988. In 1983, 52 years after the film, Harris resumed a friendship with Frankenstein actress Mae Clarke who resided at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital.

Ignacio "Nacio" Herb Brown (February 22, 1896 – September 28, 1964) was an American writer of popular songs, movie scores, and Broadway theatre music in the 1920s through the early 1950s.

Ignacio Herb Brown (some sources indicate his birth name was Ignacio Herbert Brown) was born in Deming, New Mexico to Ignacio and Cora Brown. He had an older sister, Charlotte.[1] In 1901 his family moved to Los Angeles, where he attended Manual Arts High School. His music education started with instruction from his mother, Cora Alice (Hopkins) Brown. Brown first operated a tailoring business (1916), and then became a financially successful realtor, but he always wrote and played. After his first hit "Coral Sea" (1920) and first big hit, "When Buddha Smiles" (1921), he eventually became a full-time composer. He joined The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1927.

In 1928 he was hired to work in Hollywood by MGM and write film scores for the new medium of sound film. For his film work, he often collaborated with lyricist Arthur Freed. Their music is collected for the most part in Singin'' in the Rain. He appeared in the MGM variety film The Hollywood Revue of 1929. Brown also worked with Richard A. Whiting and Buddy De Sylva on Broadway Musicals such as Take a Chance.

Along with L. Wolfe Gilbert, Nacio wrote the music for the popular children''s television western, Hopalong Cassidy which first aired in 1949.

He spent two days in the UCSF Medical Center, then died on September 28, 1964 in San Francisco, California at the home of his children, Nacio Jan Brown and Candace Nacio Brown.', 'Deming, New Mexico, USA', 1, '/4LDF2zUhvgXvr3zsBuUFJ56gbat.jpg'),

He holds a BA and an MA in Cultural studies, Comparative Literature, Cinema and an MBA from Paris-Sorbonne University and the University of Luxembourg.

He is the Managing Director of E33Motion Pictures and Film and contributes to Spinal Cord Research. He is fluent in French, English, Greek, and speaks also German, Italian and Luxembourgish. While at the Faculty, he achieved excellence in Fiction Writing under the supervision of French Novelist D. Barbéris.

His artistic career was cut abruptly in 1997 following a serious accident during an academic and artistic trip in the South of France. Left with Tetraplegia, he was far from convinced that an acting career would ever be possible. After an unexpected full recovery, while continuing to gather acting experience in major features in Europe he also enrolled in the Los Angeles Acting Academy in California, working with American actress Sydney Walsh, confirming his resolve to increase his skills and with the goal of making a decent living out of acting, writing and directing. After some small parts in French, German, Luxembourgish and American productions such as De-Lovely, directed by Irwin Winkler, starring Kevin Klein, Jonathan Pryce, Ashley Judd, and a brief appearance in Gilles'' Wife by director Frederic Fonteyne, starring Emmanuelle Devos and Clovis Cornillac, he had the opportunity to be auditioned for the Merchant of Venice by director Michael Radford in the role of Leonardo, providing him with a chance to act side by side with Joseph Fiennes, Al Pacino, and Jeremy Irons. With a remarkable audition and a contract signed at hand, he was mysteriously dropped by a co-production and the role was finally given to Tony Schiena. After being offered contract compensation, he gently refused any cent and spent the next six months isolated, focusing on his screenplays and music compositions. He thus continued with a brief appearance as a Journalist in the feature Tempesta by Tim Disney with Malcolm McDowell and Rutger Hauer. Finally, he spent valuable time on European stages before moving to Ireland and focus on his writings. From 2012 to 2013, he has worked with famous directors, such as Eric Rochant, in the new thriller Möbius and made a break through with stars such as Tim Roth, Cecile de France, Jean Dujardin, and John Lynch.  Most recently, co-starred in the feature of director Nicolas Bary, The Scapegoat, original title Au bonheur des ogres, with Berenice Bejo, Emir Kusturica, Guillaume de Tonquedec, and R.Personnaz.', 'Belgium', 1, '/9WbW5OA5sNDeK3RwkM5fr16mfCP.jpg'),

He has won two Citra Awards for Best Leading Actor at the Indonesian Film Festival, for Lagu untuk Seruni (1990) and Identitas (2008).

Tio was born on 2 September 1963 in Jakarta. He showed interest in the arts at an early age, taking up dance while in elementary school. In senior high he was active with the school''s theatre troupe, and after graduating in 1985 Tio enrolled in the Jakarta Art Institute. On the side he worked as a model, and in 1987 he made his feature film debut playing opposite Rano Karno in Bilur-Bilur Penyesalan (Stripes of Regret), an adaptation of the novel by Mira W.

In 1988 Tio took four roles, including one in Catatan Si Boy II (Boy''s Diary II), which gave him national recognition. His fame was cemented through his role in Garin Nugroho''s Cinta Dalam Sepotong Roti (Love in a Slice of Bread; 1990), which won the Citra Award for Best Film at the 1991 Indonesian Film Festival. Also in 1991, Tio received his first Citra Award for acting, for his role as an eccentric composer in Lagu Untuk Seruni.

During the early 1990s the domestic film industry faced a steep decline, and Tio began to focus on soap operas. In 1993 he established his own production hous, Kalbuku, which produced several serials, including Desy (1994), Lakon Tiga Duda (Story of Three Widowers; 1994), Anak-Anak Menteng (Children of Menteng; 1996), Telaga Kesabaran (Lake of Patience; 1996), and Tirai Sutra (Silk Curtains; 1996).[3] The company, although initially highly successful, soon faced financial problems and closed; Tio also began facing a drug addiction. His last feature film role of the millennium was in Kuldesak (Dead End), an indie film co-directed by Mira Lesmana, Riza Mantovani, Riri Riza and Nan Triveni. The film was released in 1999.

Tio would not reenter the film industry until 2004, when he portrayed a "sugar daddy" in Hanny Saputra''s film Virgin. His next film role, in Nia Dinata''s Berbagi Suami (Love for Share; 2006), was as a polygamist who fears his four wives. Since 2007, Tio has appeared in at least two films every year. These span a variety of genres, including the horror film Legenda Sundel Bolong (Legend of Sundel Bolong; 2007), comedy Quickie Express (2007), drama Sang Penari (The Dancer; 2011), and thriller Pintu Terlarang (The Forbidden Door; 2009).

In 2010 Tio was granted the title Kanjeng Raden Tumenggung from the royal court at Sultanate of Yogyakarta; from which he is descended. That year he also established an acting school in Kemang, South Jakarta, because he considered the quality of most new Indonesian actors and actresses to be poor. The school teaches a method of acting developed by Tio himself.

Soon after, Buutz disbanded and Shamari formed the urban female group Intrigue. During that time, Shamari met Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes of TLC, which resulted in the 1996 joining of Brandi D. Williams and Natina Reed, which together formed the sensational, multi-platinum R&amp;B-Pop female group Blaque.

Much of his directing work is available on Fandor, including his 2014 sophomore feature Her Wilderness, which has been called "a unique work with a distinctive voice" (Indiewire), "a vibrant fantasy that transcends the narrative form" (Smells Like Screen Spirit), and "at once alien and achingly resonant...burrows deep into your subconscious like a vivid fever dream" (Indie Outlook). His performances have been seen at festivals such as Cannes Semaine de la Critique, Sundance, Berlinale, SXSW, New Directors/New Films, AFI, Viennale, BAMcinemafest, Slamdance, and the American Film Festival in Wroclaw. Frank''s leading role in Cameron Bruce Nelson''s 2014 IFP Narrative Labs feature Some Beasts has been called "one of his best performances to date" (Hammer To Nail), "a subtle, quiet miracle...a career making performance with physical choices that leap off the screen" (Truth On Cinema), and won him the Independent Visions Special Jury Prize for Outstanding Performance at the 2016 Sarasota Film Festival. He''s acted in other films such as Shane Carruth''s Upstream Color (2013 Sundance Special Jury Prize winner), Daniel Patrick Carbone''s segment in the omnibus feature Collective Unconscious, Calvin Reeder''s companion films The Bulb and The Procedure (2016 Sundance winner for U.S. Short Fiction), Jon Jost''s final narrative film They Had It Coming, Zachary Shedd''s Americana, Dustin Guy Defa''s Person to Person, and Justin D.

Outside of his WWE work, Layfield is a financial analyst for Fox News. Within WWE, he was previously known by the ring name Bradshaw, and prior to that, the variations Justin "Hawk" Bradshaw and Blackjack Bradshaw (as half of The New Blackjacks withBlackjack Windham). As JBL, Layfield was WWE Champion for 280 days.  Layfield''s main gimmick as JBL—a wealthy, gladhanding, big-mouthed, fiery-tempered businessman—was based on Layfield''s real-life accomplishments as a stock market investor. Layfield is a guest panelist on Fox News Channel''s The Cost of Freedom, has appeared on CNBC, and has written a best-selling book on financial planning called Have More Money Now. (ISBN 0-7434-6633-0). Layfield also hosts a weekend talk radio program, syndicated nationally by Talk Radio Network, in which he discusses his conservative political views. Layfield is also employed by Northeast Securities as its Senior Vice President.  In WWE, Layfield won 24 total championships including one reign as WWE Champion, one reign as United States Champion, one reign as European Champion, seventeen reigns as Hardcore Champion, one reign as Intercontinental Champion, and three reigns as World Tag Team Champion with Faarooq as part of the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA). He is also recognized as the twentieth Triple Crown Champion, and the  Sports Illustrated has said that Layfield "has been accused for years of being a locker room bully",while Deadspin wrote that "backstage tales of Layfield''s hazing and bullying have long been legend among hardcore wrestling fans."[136] Dayton Daily News described that "YouTube has dozens of interviews where former [WWE] performers discuss harassment, bullying and taking real blows from Layfield while wrestling him in supposedly choreographed matches." Le Journal de Montréal listed Mark Henry, Matt Hardy, René Duprée, Daivari, and Ivory, among others, as wrestlers who in interviews described Layfield as a bully.In 2010, The Miz referenced Layfield in an onscreen promo about hazing he faced in the locker room early in his career. Layfield admitted to hazing Miz and said that he did not regret doing so.

In April 2017, WWE commentator Mauro Ranallo took an absence from WWE, which Dave Meltzer reported had been triggered by hostilities with Layfield.The allegations coincided with the release of former WWE ring announcer Justin Roberts'' autobiography, in which he alleged that Layfield encouraged Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury to steal his passport.Angered WWE fans subsequently called on WWE to fire Layfield. On April 22, Newsweek reported that Ranallo and WWE "mutually agreed to part ways", and Ranallo released a statement in which he said his departure had "nothing to do with JBL" after liking tweets that implied JBL was the main reason. Layfield released a statement of his own, stating: "Admittedly, I took part in locker room pranks that existed within the industry years ago. WWE addressed my behavior and I responded accordingly, yet my past is being brought up because of recent unfounded rumors.

The very first Hal Roach film in the series was shot in the spring of 1922 and released on November 5th.

Sadly, no negatives or complete prints exist and is  considered a lost film.

James Francis Thorpe (Sac and Fox (Sauk): Wa-Tho-Huk, translated as "Bright Path"; May 22 or 28, 1887 – March 28, 1953) was an American athlete and Olympic gold medalist. A member of the Sac and Fox Nation, Thorpe became the first Native American to win a gold medal for the United States. Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, he won Olympic gold medals in the 1912 pentathlon and decathlon, and played American football (collegiate and professional), professional baseball, and basketball. He lost his Olympic titles after it was found he had been paid for playing two seasons of semi-professional baseball before competing in the Olympics, thus violating the amateurism rules that were then in place. In 1983, 30 years after his death, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) restored his Olympic medals.

Thorpe grew up in the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma, and attended Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he was a two-time All-American for the school''s football team. After his Olympic success in 1912, which included a record score in the decathlon, he added a victory in the All-Around Championship of the Amateur Athletic Union. In 1913, Thorpe signed with the New York Giants, and he played six seasons in Major League Baseball between 1913 and 1919. Thorpe joined the Canton Bulldogs American football team in 1915, helping them win three professional championships; he later played for six teams in the National Football League (NFL). He played as part of several all-American Indian teams throughout his career, and barnstormed as a professional basketball player with a team composed entirely of American Indians.

From 1920 to 1921, Thorpe was nominally the first president of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which became the NFL in 1922. He played professional sports until age 41, the end of his sports career coinciding with the start of the Great Depression. He struggled to earn a living after that, working several odd jobs. He suffered from alcoholism, and lived his last years in failing health and poverty. He was married three times and had eight children, before suffering from heart failure and dying in 1953.

Thorpe has received various accolades for his athletic accomplishments. The Associated Press named him the "greatest athlete" from the first 50 years of the 20th century, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame inducted him as part of its inaugural class in 1963. A Pennsylvania town was named in his honor and a monument site there is the site of his remains, which were the subject of legal action. Thorpe appeared in several films and was portrayed by Burt Lancaster in the 1951 film Jim Thorpe – All-American.', 'Prague, Indian Territory [now Oklahoma], USA', 1, '/37NejI3QvYLDruZqW97BChgxTeT.jpg'),

Georgia Caine (30 October 1876 – 4 April 1964) was an American actress who performed both on Broadway and in more than 80 films in her 51-year career.

Born in San Francisco, California in 1876, the daughter of two Shakespearean actors, George Caine and the former Jennie Darragh, she travelled with them when they toured the country. Caine left school at the age of 17 to join a Shakespearean repertory company. She made her Broadway debut in 1899 as the star of the musical A Reign of Error. Caine continued to perform continuously on Broadway as a star or featured performer, primarily in musicals, until the mid-1930s, including in George M. Cohan''s Little Nellie Kelly, as well as his Mary, and The O''Brien Girls,. She appeared in Franz Lehár''s The Merry Widow both on Broadway and in London.

Caine was often written about by theater columnists until the 1930s, when her star had started to fade. She made her last Broadway appearance in 1935, in Damon Runyon and Howard Lindsay''s A Slight Case of Murder.

With her stage career fading, Caine took advantage of the advent of talking pictures to change her focus and moved to California to work in Hollywood. In 1930, Caine made her first film, Good Intentions, and in the next twenty years appeared in 83 films, mostly playing character roles – mothers, aunts, and older neighbors – although she occasionally played against type, such as when she was a streetwalker in Camille (1936). Many of her parts were small and she did not receive screen credit for them.

In 1940, Caine appeared as Barbara Stanwyck''s mother in the film Remember the Night, which was written by Preston Sturges, and she would go on to become part of Sturges'' unofficial "stock company" of character actresses, appearing in seven other films written by Sturges.

Caine made her final film appearance in 1950, at the age of 73, in Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye.

According to Marie Dressler The Unlikeliest Star by Betty Lee, about Caine''s friend Marie Dressler, Caine was married to a prominent man from San Francisco by the 1920s, but the book gives no information on what his name was or when or for how long they were married.

Georgia Caine died in Hollywood, California on 4 April 1964, at the age of 87, and is buried in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, California.', 'San Francisco, California, USA', 1, '/3DucLH6Iw0RuhIJIaMDlwbz9zca.jpg'),

At the age of 4 his mother Milica relocated the family to Toronto, the city George has proudly called home ever since. He attended Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate and was a regular fixture in school plays, talent shows, and the voice of morning announcements.

After working as a stunt performer for several years, George decided to pursue his true passion for acting, leading him to New York City, where in 2007 he graduated from the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting.

Once back in Toronto George made a hard shift into acting with swift and relative success landing a slew of principal roles which led to his first guest star on the hit series Covert Affairs, opposite Piper Perabo. Some other guest roles include HBO Canada''s Living In Your Car, Warehouse 13, Heartland, Rookie Blue, The Listener, CTV''s Motive, CW''s hit series Arrow, and Syfy''s new series Killjoys.

In 2010 George was honoured and thrilled to join the cast of the Canadian Box Office smash hit comedy GOON, penned by Canadian Legend Jay Baruchel, and directed by Canada''s own Michael Dowse. Other film roles include the TIFF Award winning Antiviral, David Hayter''s Wolves, and the recent short film Honor Code by Pascal Trottier.

Known for his character work and physicality, George is a funny and light hearted guy, who shows no sign of slowing down.

And after honing his skills on New Zealand Television,  Stephen headed for Australia.

It didn''t take long for his talents  to be recognized - and not just for comedy. In 2006, after several  guest roles on both sides of the Tasman, Stephen landed the part of  Sharpie in the second series of the 2 time Logie Award winning drama  Love My Way. This was closely followed in 2008 by a leading guest role  on Channel 7''s long running Australian medical drama All Saints, a role  that showed his depth and versatility as a dramatic actor.

But it  is his comedic ability that has Stephen in high demand on screen in  both New Zealand and Australia. Stints on Nickelodeans The GO Show and  ABC''s Review with Miles Barlow only confirmed that status.

His  strong resonant voice has also seen Stephen become one of Australasia''s  top Voice actors. These skills have been used to promote some of  Australia &amp; New Zealand''s top companies and products. And in 2009,  Stephen landed a lead role in the ABC animated series CJ the DJ, as the  lovable Si.

        (1200864, 'Lakeith Stanfield', '1991-08-12', 'Lakeith Lee "Keith" Stanfield (born August 12, 1991) is an American actor and rapper. He made his feature film debut in Short Term 12 (2013), for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. In 2014, he co-starred in the horror film The Purge: Anarchy and in the Martin Luther King biopic Selma, as civil right activist Jimmie Lee Jackson. Stanfield appeared in the film Dope (2015). He played rapper Snoop Dogg in the biopic about the hip-hop group N.W.A, Straight Outta Compton (2015), and will appear in the upcoming Oliver Stone biopic Snowden (2015).

Stanfield was born in San Bernardino, California and grew up in Riverside and Victorville, California. He has said that he "grew up very poor in a fractured family that was dysfunctional on both sides". He decided to become an actor when he was 14 years old, when he joined his high school''s drama club. He attended the John Casablancas Modeling and Career Center in Los Angeles, where he was signed by an agency manager and began to audition for commercials.

Stanfield''s first role was in the short film Short Term 12 (2009), which was filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton''s thesis project at San Diego State University, and won the Jury Award for U.S. Short Filmmaking at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. A year later, he appeared in the short film Gimme Grace (2010), before he gave up acting for several years. He went on to work a number of different jobs—roof work, gardening, at AT&T, and at a legal marijuana factory—before he was contacted by Cretton to reappear in a feature-length adaptation of Short Term 12, his first feature film. For the duration of the film''s production, Stanfield practiced method acting, distancing himself from the other cast members like his character, Marcus. He was the only actor to appear in both the short and feature films.

Short Term 12 won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the 2013 South by Southwest film festival, and Stanfield was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. The film featured "Vicious", a rap song co-written with Milgaten, and "So You Know What It''s Like", a rap song co-written with Cretton, which a number of Oscar pundits predicted would be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, although it did not ultimately receive a nomination.

In 2014, Stanfield co-starred in The Purge: Anarchy and Selma, in the latter playing civil rights activist Jimmie Lee Jackson. He is set to appear in James Franco''s upcoming film Memoria and in Don Cheadle''s Miles Ahead. Stanfield will also star in the fantasy horror thriller film King Ripple, by the Michigan filmmaker Luke Jaden, and the music video for the Run the Jewels song "Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)". In 2015, he portrayed rapper Snoop Dogg in the biopic Straight Outta Compton.

He quickly moved on to other instruments (bass) in order to learn to not only play, but write his own songs, later taking voice lessons to handle lead vocals.

At age 16, an interest in acting resurfaced. He studied acting in high school and college, then found theater roles both in school and regionally, eventually landing extra / featured roles in several major motion pictures.

At this point music became the focus. He wrote, recorded and toured nationally with several bands, most notably April Fool, "The End", "The Facts", The Rage and Road Trip learning to play both keyboards and guitar in the process.

In 2004, Lombardi again became focused on acting, signed with several agencies and began modeling while taking additional acting classes. Since then he has appeared in many films, television shows and commercials in a variety of roles in films such as The Happening, Bazookas: The Movie, Masks, Stand Off, Perfect: Android Rising and The Cemetery, as well as the popular fan films Krueger: Another Tale from Elm Street, The Nightmare Ends on Halloween II (as the iconic Freddy Krueger), Escape from New Jersey and Mr. J . He also starred in the ensemble tv series Brotherhood of Silver, The Underground Kings and Phantom Faye.

Lombardi has worked behind the camera as well as in front with Actor, Producer and Assistant Director credits for Abduction and Paranormal Captivity. He is attached with Actor and Producer credit for the upcoming Extinction and directed the short film Masks: Facade. He has also been credited for Casting, Location Scout and Script Supervisor as well as doing Special FX Makeup and contributing music to Film Soundtracks.

His production company ''RTL Productions'' focuses on the development, publicity and production of new film projects such as Just Like Me which he produced as well as acted in. The company also releases Lombardi''s past and future music projects and licenses music for film soundtracks. Roberto Lombardi also wrote the screenplay for the supernatural crime drama Voosha Day. Lombardi is also a producer for Blinky Productions, Inc., but mainly concentrates on acting.

With John Orrichio Films, he worked as a Publicist, Assistant Director and Producer for many projects including the comedy spoof series Ghost Blunders which he also starred in and the ghost hunting reality series Ghost Chicks.

While Plumb declined to reprise the role of Jan in the first spin-off, the TV variety show The Brady Bunch Variety Hour (1976-1977) as she did not want to sign a five-year contract (the show was canceled after nine episodes), she did appear as Jan in the subsequent spin-offs featuring the original cast: the TV movie The Brady Girls Get Married (1981) (1981), the short-lived sitcom The Brady Brides (1981), the TV movie A Very Brady Christmas (1988), and another short-lived TV series, The Bradys (1990).  Though she has worked steadily in TV since a child, her only other major role was as a teenage hooker in the 1976 TV movie Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway.

James is the youngest of three sons of Johnny McGowan a former light heavyweight boxer from Northern England. James grew up on the West Island in Montreal. He graduated from Concordia University with a B.A. in Communications. After graduation he took a job as a copy writer at an advertising agency rather than pursue an acting career as he did not believe he could make a living acting. He then took in the audio-visual department of McGill University. While there he got in touch with a friend who was directing plays at the Montreal university expecting to pursue acting as a hobby. He started out slowly doing student plays at the William Shatner Building. He loved it so much he decided to pursue it as a profession. It wasn''t easy breaking into television in Toronto given his age (36) at the time as he was going up against other actors with lengthier resumes. It was hard at first to get auditions. He started out with guest spots in television shows such as the La Femme Nikita, Mutant-X, Falcon Beach, and Rent-a-Goalie. James also had minor roles in movies such as The Perfect Man with Heather Locklear, The Prince and Me with Julie Stiles, and Silent Night with Linda Hamilton. He has had success with two successful television ads. The first ad was entitled Doctor''s Appointment and addressed the serious problem of erectile dysfunction. The ad was run continuously throughout the 2001 NHL Finals. The second ad was entitled The Deal and was for Verizon Wireless. One of his first big parts was a role in the TV movie 10,000 Black Men Named George. The 2002 film helped James find more work but he did not find substantial work until he auditioned for the CBC drama The Border. He had sent in an audition tape but had not heard back. He went to Winnipeg to film a guest part on the TV series Falcon Beach. While he was in Winnipeg, his agent contacted him and told him the show''s casting directors wanted to meet with him. A second day of callbacks was added and he was able to return to Toronto in time. No one had heard of James but according to Peter Raymont, the co-creator of the show, James brought just the right degree of intelligence, compassion and authority to the character. While the producers were sure that James was right for the part, the network wasn''t so sure. One of his biggest credits to that point was playing the goon in the Verizon Wireless commercial. His peers obviously approve of the portrayal. James received a Gemini nomination as outstanding actor in a drama.  - IMDb Mini Biography', 'Montreal - Quebec - Canada', 1, '/9086jMSVEO7CmavqgONEb9tobh7.jpg'),

He was best known for his work in World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation under the ring names Chris Kanyon (or simply Kanyon) and Mortis. As a youth, Kanyon played roller hockey, basketball, and baseball at school. He attended Archbishop Molloy High School, located in Queens NY, graduating in 1988. In 1992 he graduated from the University at Buffalo with a bachelor''s degree in physical therapy. During his time there, he was a member of the Mad Turtles, the University of Buffalo Rugby Football Club. Kanyon worked full-time as a physical therapist for three years before becoming a wrestler. Kanyon debuted in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as a jobber. After several months he was placed with Mark Starr in a tag team called "Men at Work". Their gimmick was that they were two construction workers turned wrestlers who wore jeans to the ring, and that Kanyon would cause the team to suffer losses by taking measurements with his tape measure at inopportune times. Kanyon was replaced with Mike Winner before the team disbanded altogether.

Kanyon appeared on the CNN special Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling, in November 2007 following the aftermath of the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide. On the program, Kanyon stated that on September 14, 2003 he had taken 50 sleeping pills in a suicide attempt.

In the early hours of October 16, 2004, he was arrested in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida for "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest without violence" after attempting to break up a fight. He was released that same day after fellow wrestler Altar Boy Luke provided a US$750 cash bond. Kanyon publicly stated he did nothing wrong, and the case was thrown out of court.

Kanyon, along with Raven and Michael Sanders, attempted to sue WWE for "cheating them out of health care and other benefits" but a federal judge in Stamford, Connecticut dismissed the case.

In 2004, after Kanyon''s release from WWE, he began a gimmick in which he was an openly gay wrestler. This included a publicity stunt wherein he stated that WWE released him from his contract because of his sexuality. Kanyon later told reporters and radio personalities that this was just a publicity stunt.[6] He later retracted these statements and acknowledged that he was in fact gay. Before his death Kanyon was working on a book, Wrestling Reality, with Ryan Clark. The book was released November 1, 2011, and it details Kanyon''s struggles as a closeted gay man.

Death

Kanyon had been suffering from bipolar disorder, and he threatened suicide in the weeks prior to his death. On April 2, 2010, his brother Ken Klucsarits found him dead in his Sunnyside, Queens, New York apartment with an empty bottle of antidepressants. He left behind a note of apology for his family.

Robert David Hall (born November 9, 1947) is an American actor, best known for his role as coronerDr. Albert Robbins M.D. on the television showCSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

Born in East Orange, New Jersey, Hall attended Tustin High School in California and went on to graduate from UCLA in 1971 with a degree in English Literature. Hall is a former professional musician and accomplished guitarist, and is also proficient on piano and mandolin.[1] For several years he was a high profile radio DJ in Los Angeles. He has also done extensive voice work on television commercials and cartoons.

In 1978, Robert had to have both of his legs amputated as a result of an accident in which an 18-wheeler truck crushed his car. The accident also caused the gasoline tank of the car to explode, causing burns over 65% of his body. He now comfortably uses prosthetic limbs, allowing for personal mobility. Several of his characters, including his CSI character, have openly shared this disability. He is a prominent advocate for disabled Americans.

In addition to starring on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Robert has appeared in such films as Starship Troopers and The Negotiator and has made guest appearances in a number of TV programs including The West Wing and L.A. Law. He also furnishes the narration on CourtTV''s documentary series North Mission Road. Currently, Hall is working on the short thriller "The Roymann Closure in the Netherlands", written by writer/director David Grifhorst and executive producer Jop Douma.

In his personal life, Robert was married to Susan Petroni from 1969 until their divorce in 1974, and Connie Cole from 1979 until their divorce in 1987. His son, Andrew, was born of his second marriage. Hall''s third and current marriage is to Judy Sterns in 1999.', 'East Orange, New Jersey, USA', 1, '/dx3rfnrLo6rZV5sfjV0O165tVfS.jpg'),

While attending high school in Casa Grande, Arizona, Cox played football and acted in nearly every play the school put on.

At  University of Arizona in Tucson, he started in pre-med, majoring in  Biology, but he went to see Mourning Becomes Electra at the university  theater, and a week later he changed his major to Theater/Performance  Option. Classical training ensued.

While at U of A, he was hired  by Leonard Katzman to play a Comanchero in an episode of "Gunsmoke"  being shot at Old Tucson. The SAG card from that made him eligible to  audition for Lee Phillips, who cast him as The Lieutenant in the film  for television of "The Red Badge of Courage" with Richard Thomas as The  Youth.

Streeter took up freediving at age 25 and almost immediately began to break records. She made her first important breakthrough in 1998 when she bettered Deborah Andollo''s Women''s No Limits diving record by 10 feet, achieving a total depth of 370 feet (113 m). She was inducted into the Women Diver''s Hall of Fame in March 2000. In 2002, she broke the men''s No Limit (NLT) world diving record by diving to a depth of 525 feet (160 m) near the Turks and Caicos Islands, a record which was surpassed later that year by French diver Loïc Leferme (162 m).

On 19 July 2003 she broke the men''s Variable Weight (VWT) world record by diving to a depth of 400 feet (122 m) and held it over a year until the record was broken by Carlos Coste (135 m) in Puerto la Cruz, Venezuela on 27 October 2004, but as a women''s record it lasted almost seven years, until Natalia Molchanova reached 125 m in June 2010 in Kalamata, Greece.

Streeter was featured in an Animal Planet documentary, Freediver (aired March 2006), and presented Dive Galapagos (aired March 2007). She presented a documentary shown on BBC Two called Shark Therapy in which she attempted to overcome her fear of sharks.

His career began August 16, 1996 when he entered Stern''s studio at radio station WXRK (K-Rock) in New York City. Hank was 4 ft 1 in (1.24 m) tall, and weighed 95 lb (43 kg; 6.8 st).

Hank received widespread media coverage in 1998 when he won a People magazine online poll asking the public to vote for the most beautiful person in the world as part of the run up promotion for the magazine''s "50 Most Beautiful People" issue. When the public was given the option to submit a write-in candidate, the magazine had not counted on 230,169 votes for Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf—beating out assorted celebrities by a wide margin. In third place was Leonardo DiCaprio with 14,471 votes. In the relatively still early years of public participation on the Internet, various media critics picked up on this, wondering whether this was evidence of an emerging digital democracy. Talk of Hank''s death in the media was cut short by the events of 9/11. Early in the 8 O''Clock hour of the Stern Show on 9/11, Stern was interviewing an executive from the E! channel who said that they were going to produce an E! True Hollywood Story about Hank and that Hank actually had quite a few friends in the entertainment industry. (The first plane crashed into the World Trade Center at 8:46am). The episode, "Hank the Angry Dwarf", aired February 20, 2002, according to TV Guide On the afternoon of September 4, 2001, Hank died in his sleep at the home he shared with his parents in Fall River. His mother discovered that he had died when she went to wake him. He was 39 years old. His death certificate listed his immediate cause of death as a seizure disorder, with ethanol abuse and chondrodystrophy as contributing factors. Hank is buried at the Notre Dame Cemetery in Fall River, Massachusetts. The next day, Howard Stern devoted most of the show to Hank.

Hank''s mother, Claudette, called into the Stern Show on September 10, 2001 to publicly thank everyone who attended Hank''s funeral and wake. She also thanked everyone who e-mailed, and sent their condolences. She told an anecdote about how someone in the family had put a can of beer in Hank''s casket. She said that "someone else slipped a bottle of Jack Daniel''s in under Hank''s coat."[41] She ultimately left the items in the casket because she said that''s what Hank would have wanted.', 'Fall River, Massachusetts, USA', 1, '/38WFP9ekPLWRrwPZfT5KfBLAp9y.jpg'),

At  seven, they settled in Beaumont, Texas where Harry learned yo play  drums. By twelve, he was playing trumpet in the Christy Brothers circus  band. In 1936 James joined Ben Pollack''s band, soon leaving to lead the brass section of Benny Goodman''s band. He even once applied to Lawrence Welk''s  band but was turned down because they said he played too loud and it  was not Welk''s style. After three years with Goodman, he wanted to  leave, and with Goodman''s backing, he formed the Music Makers. In 1943  he married pinup queen Betty Grable,  his second of four wives. He had earlier married and divorced Louise  Tobin, a singer. Grable kept appearing in movies and Harry kept playing  while they raised horses. He made his debut in Philadelphia at the Ben  Franklin Hotel and soon was a nationwide favorite of dance lovers and  jazz addicts, rocking the rafters at the Hollywood Paladium, Chicago''s  famous College Inn at the Hotel Sherman, Frank Dailey''s Meadowbrook in  Cedar Cove, NJ, and then onto New York City. It was the Lincoln Hotel in  NYC that the Music Makers called home, but James also starred at the  Paramount Theater in the spring of 1943, with thousands of teenagers  flocking to see him. His version of You Made Me Love You was a big hit and a favorite of many through the war years. James was a great discoverer of talent, finding Frank Sinatra working as a waiter in a New Jersey restaurant and giving him a job singing in his band. Dick Haymes, Kitty Kallen, Connie Haines and Helen Forrest  can all thank James for giving them their first real break. In 1963 his  band was featured at Disneyland, still known as the Music Makers.

Clement''s father rose to become the managing director of a toy manufacturers in London and married five times in total over the course of his life. Clement was sent to boarding school on the South Downs, where she was—by her own admission—"very naughty".

His father, George, a former police officer, named his daughter, Liberty and son, Justice after vowing to do so while a young soldier in Vietnam. "My Dad said if he made it back home, he''d give us these names after his love for his country."  During his childhood, Justice was anything but fond of his name. "As a kid, you don''t want to stick out. And when I was introduced to people, my name was (and still is) a conversation starter, which for me was a nightmare." Leak said. "But as you get older, you realize that it''s good to have something that makes you different from everyone else."  Leak was a shy kid who "could easily blend into the walls." His quiet nature, however, made him a keen observer of human behavior, a skill that has served him well.  "All my life''s experiences -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- have been preparing me to do this thing (acting). That''s why I''m so thankful that I wasn''t a popular kid!"  His first stint in the spotlight came during his senior year at Jefferson Davis High School. He was chosen to lead the marching band, and recalls his experience as drum major as the "best of both worlds in terms of performing and music."  "For the first time, I was in a leadership position," Leak said. "I couldn''t hide behind anybody else, and looking back, that was the beginning point for me coming out of my shell."  After graduation, Leak attended college in Texas and later Auburn University. While there, he became involved in the drama department, mainly working behind the scenes. But that all changed when he helped a classmate with an audition.  "I told the director that I wasn''t auditioning and was only helping," Leak said. "Afterwards, he stepped up and said, ''Why aren''t you auditioning? You would be great in one of the leads.''"  His first role was the lead in Arthur Miller''s, "The Crucible." During his senior year, he starred in every main stage play produced at Auburn and earned two Irene Ryan Award nominations. He was also named "best actor" by the university''s faculty and students.  After earning a degree in theatre arts, Leak moved to Atlanta and was signed to the agency, People Store. He began doing commercials for companies such as Verizon Wireless, and later, had small roles in TV shows and independent films.  His agent felt he could do more and sent his resume to the casting directors for "The Great Debaters," a career changing moment.  As the buzz of The Great Debaters crossed the country, so did Justice, making his move from the east to the west coast; capitalizing on the momentum of this success. Once in Los Angeles, he was quickly signed by two leading agencies and booked back to back to back guest starring roles on three major network shows within a month''s time - and the momentum shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.  Leak plans to remain humble, no matter how successful he becomes.  "I want to be known as a good soul with a kind heart, and a great artist who had the chance to make a difference in this world for the better and succeeded."', 'Montgomery - Alabama - USA', 1, '/j3I7uCurLq88wpAq8fWOGEtUett.jpg'),

Leslie David Baker (born February 19, 1958) is an American film and television actor. He is known for his portrayal of Stanley Hudson in The Office. He also had several small roles in Scrubs and appeared on That ''70s Show as a janitor after a Ted Nugent concert and played an office worker in several of OfficeMax''s "Rubberband Man" series of advertisements. He holds a B.S. in Psychology from Loyola University Chicagoand a M.S. Human Services Administration fromSpertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership inChicago. He taught special education, grades K-8, while working on his masters. He was reluctant to move to Hollywood, as he thought it important to first attain financial security. He once played a police officer and a customer in a stereo store in Malcolm in the Middle and a security guard in Action. His favorite episodes of The Office are "Did I Stutter" and "Basketball".  In November 2011, Baker released his debut single, "2 Be Simple", with an accompanying music video. Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the song is "destined to be the party anthem at all your yuletide throwdowns," while Cameron Mathews of Spinnerdescribed the hook as "infectious" and the lyrics as "totally [capturing] the daydreams of a middle-aged man in crisis."', 'Chicago, Illinois, USA', 1, '/9h3xlV5IYqKinlQCW1ouU7sjwWF.jpg'),

Unfortunately,  her cinematic offerings wound up being pretty minimal and her last  years were marred by depression and, ultimately, a tragic end.

She was born Dorothy E. Abbott on December 16, 1920, in Kansas City, Missouri and started her career off as a chorine with Earl Carroll  and his Los Angeles-based revues and in Las Vegas showrooms where she  was dubbed the rather mystifying title of "The Girl with the Golden  Arm". Paramount Studios perked up on the lovely blonde with the Betty  Page-like bangs and gave her a starting contract at $150 a week. Groomed  in dozens of decorative "good time girl" bits -- dancers, chorus girls,  waitresses, stewardesses, party girls, nurses and models -- she was at  the same time promoted as a cheesecake pinup, "winning" such dubious  titles as "Miss Wilshire Club," "Miss Los Angeles Transit" and "Miss Oil  Cans". The dusky-voiced Dorothy was usually briefly seen and not heard in such dramatic and lightweight fare as The Razor''s Edge (1946), Road to Rio (1947), Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948) (in which she has her first speaking role as a maid), Words and Music (1948), Take Me Out to the Ball Game (1949), Little Women (1949), Neptune''s Daughter (1949), Annie Get Your Gun (1950), His Kind of Woman (1951), Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick (1952), _The Las Vegas Story (1952)_, The Caddy (1953), There''s No Business Like Show Business (1954), Love Me or Leave Me (1955), Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Jailhouse Rock (1957), South Pacific (1958), The Apartment (1960), That Touch of Mink (1962), A Gathering of Eagles (1963) and Dear Heart (1964). Her one starring role came early in the exploitative, lowbudget potboiler A Virgin in Hollywood (1953) as a star reporter out to get a seamy Hollywood story, but she was unable to capitalize on it. Working  bit parts at the studio during the days, she would often perform on  stage in little theatre shows at night. On the sly, when work was  meager, she became a real estate agent in the 1950s in order to help  supplement her income. TV chores included guest roles in "Leave It to  Beaver" and "Ozzie and Harriet". She also had a recurring part for one  season as Jack Webb ''s girlfriend on the Dragnet (1954) series.

Dorothy  married LAPD narcotics squad officer-turned homicide detective Adolph  Rudy Diaz in 1949. Diaz, who was of Native American (Apache) descent,  eventually retired as a cop in order to pursue acting. By this time, the  marriage was in trouble and the couple separated. Going by the stage  name of Rudy Diaz in 1967, he began to get work and was seen out in public with other  women. The divorce was finalized in 1968, but Dorothy took it hard and  never seemed to get over it. On December 15, 1968, she committed suicide  at her Los Angeles home -- one day before her 48th birthday. She was  interred (as Dorothy E. Diaz) at Rose Hills Memorial Park, Whittier, Los  Angeles County, California, Plot: Valley Lawn, Lot 2939.', 'Kansas City, Missouri', 1, '/s2aZnW2nLqRoC6ei25Ku0y0SPJc.jpg'),

Agnes George de Mille (September 18, 1905 – October 7, 1993) was an American dancer and choreographer.

De Mille began her association with the fledgling American Ballet Theatre (then called the Ballet Theatre) in 1939, but her first significant work, Rodeo (1942) with the score by Aaron Copland, was staged for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Although de Mille continued to choreograph nearly up to the time of her death—her final ballet, The Other, was completed in 1992—most of her later works have dropped out of the ballet repertoire. Besides Rodeo, two other de Mille ballets are performed on a regular basis, Three Virgins and a Devil (1934) adapted from a tale by Giovanni Boccaccio, and Fall River Legend (1948) based on the life of Lizzie Borden.

On the strength of Rodeo, de Mille was hired to choreograph the musical show Oklahoma! (1943). The dream ballet, in which dancers Marc Platt, Katherine Sergava, and George Church doubled for the leading actors, successfully integrated dance into the musical''s plot. Instead of functioning as an interlude or divertissement, the ballet provided key insights into the heroine''s emotional troubles. De Mille went on to choreograph over a dozen other musicals, most notably Bloomer Girl (1944), Carousel (1945), Brigadoon (1947), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1949), Paint Your Wagon (1951), The Girl in Pink Tights (1954), Goldilocks (1957), and 110 in the Shade (1963).

De Mille''s success on Broadway did not translate into success in Hollywood. Her only significant film credit is Oklahoma! (1955). She was not invited to recreate her choreography for either Brigadoon or Carousel. Nevertheless, her two specials for the TV series Omnibus, "The Art of Ballet" and "The Art of Choreography" (both televised in 1956), were immediately recognized as landmark attempts to bring serious dance to the attention of a broad public.

Her love for acting played a very important role in her choreography. De Mille revolutionized musical theatre by creating choreography which not only conveyed the emotional dimensions of the characters but enhanced the plot. Her choreography, as a reflection of her awareness of acting, reflected the angst and turmoil of the characters instead of simply focusing on a dancer''s physical technique.

De Mille married Walter Prude on June 14, 1943. They had one child, Jonathan, born in 1946.

Her hobbies included collecting fine porcelain and research on the history of clothes, something at which she was an expert.

She suffered a stroke on stage in 1975, but recovered. She died in 1993 of a second stroke in her Greenwich Village apartment.', 'New York City - New York - USA', 1, NULL),

Roy Claxton Acuff (September 15, 1903 – November 23, 1992) was an American country music singer, fiddler, and promoter. Known as the "King of Country Music," Acuff is often credited with moving the genre from its early string band and "hoedown" format to the star singer-based format that helped make it internationally successful. In 1952 Hank Williams told Ralph Gleason, "He''s the biggest singer this music ever knew. You booked him and you didn''t worry about crowds. For drawing power in the South, it was Roy Acuff, then God."

Acuff began his music career in the 1930s, and gained regional fame as the singer and fiddler for his group, the Smoky Mountain Boys. He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1938, and although his popularity as a musician waned in the late 1940s, he remained one of the Opry''s key figures and promoters for nearly four decades. In 1942, Acuff co-founded the first major Nashville-based country music publishing company—Acuff-Rose Music—which signed acts such as Hank Williams, Roy Orbison, and The Everly Brothers. In 1962, Acuff became the first living inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame.', 'Maynardville, Tennessee, USA', 1, '/oiMuUwrRT80jSK0f2tYglxzwYSx.jpg'),

Sammee Tong (April 21, 1901 – October 27, 1964) was an American film and television character actor. One of Tong''s more notable roles was that of Peter Tong on the sitcom Bachelor Father, which aired on all three national networks from 1957 to 1962.

Tong signed with Columbia Pictures, and in 1934, he made his film debut in a bit part in the comedy film The Captain Hates the Sea. In 1939 he returned to his home town as director of entertainment at the Chinese Village of San Francisco''s World''s Fair, and began the first Chinese radio hour on KSAN. Throughout the 1940s, he had small, usually uncredited, roles in films. He returned to Hollywood in the early 1950s and took roles on television.

Tong made his television debut in 1953 in an episode of You Are There. The following year, he appeared in a recurring role as "George, the cook" in a series of television shorts which aired during The Mickey Mouse Club entitled The Adventures of Spin and Marty. In 1955, he reprised his role as George in the feature-length film Spin and Marty: The Movie. He also had a role in the sequel series The Further Adventures of Spin and Marty.

In 1957, he landed a co-starring role in the sitcom Bachelor Father, starring John Forsythe and Noreen Corcoran. In the series, Tong portrayed "Peter Tong", Bentley Gregg''s (Forsythe) live-in houseboy and valet. Although he was playing a servant, Tong enjoyed the role stating, "Houseboys in movies and the theater always bow low, mutter a few sing song words and disappear, but not on this show. I get dialogue and laughs."

In his Bachelor Father role, Tong was not subservient and at one point walked out because he was not paid enough. He spoke with an accent even though the actor was born in the U.S., making it hard to judge how he spoke in real life.

After Bachelor Father''s cancellation in 1962, Tong was cast as Sammy Ling in the ABC sitcom Mickey, starring Mickey Rooney. Due to low ratings, ABC was considering canceling Mickey. The network was hesitant to cancel the series due to the popularity of Tong''s character who had a solid fanbase thanks to his role in Bachelor Father. Tong''s death effectively ended any chance for the series'' survival and ABC canceled Mickey in December 1964.

His final screen appearance was as "Cook" in the 1965 film Fluffy, starring Tony Randall and Shirley Jones. The film was released after Tong''s death.  In October 1964, Tong committed suicide at the age of 63. At the time of his death, he was appearing in a supporting role on the ABC sitcom, Mickey, starring Mickey Rooney.', 'San Francisco, California, USA', 1, NULL),

Born in 1893, Dearing started in silent comedy shorts for Hal Roach, including several with Laurel and Hardy, notably in their classic Two Tars, probably his best ever screen role. He later had supporting roles in several of their features for 20th Century Fox in the 1940s.

Dearing continued in his familiar persona until the early 1950s, when he appeared in many film and television westerns, usually as a sheriff. One of his guest roles was on the syndicated television series, The Range Rider, starring Jock Mahoney and Dick Jones.

Brian Nissen (20 October 1927 in London – 8 February 2001 in Salisbury, Wiltshire) was a British actor and television continuity announcer.

Nissen made an early appearance in Laurence Olivier''s film of Shakespeare''s Henry V, and made many TV, film and stage appearances, including The Dam Busters (1955), and the television series The New Adventures of Charlie Chan and Sword of Freedom in 1957. But he is probably best-remembered as an in-vision announcer for Southern Television, where his formal style seemed to sum up the company''s aesthetic. He joined Southern at its inception in 1958 and stayed until its demise in 1981, and was kept on by the successor company TVS despite its general policy of breaking with Southern''s conservatism. He retired from TVS in August 1987. Nissen died on 8 February 2001 in Salisbury, Wiltshire at the age of 73.

Starzak was born in Suffolk in 1959 and grew up in Ipswich, attending Northgate Grammar School. After completing a degree in Fine Art at Exeter College of Art and Design specialising in animation, he experimented further with animation and DJ-ing before joining Aardman Animations in 1983 as its first employee.

During his first nine-year[5] stretch at Aardman he worked on several short films and promos including "Morph", "Sledgehammer" for Peter Gabriel, Pee-Wee''s Playhouse in New York, his own film Ident (1989), which introduced the character Rex, and two Rex the Runt pilot films. His commercial work includes Domestos Big Dom, Grolsch, Cadbury’s Creme Eggs, Weetos and Maltesers and several European commercials.

In 1992, Starzak left Aardman to pursue a freelance career during which time he worked in New Zealand as Production Adviser for Oscar and Friends, and wrote and directed 13 episodes of Rex the Runt for BBC2, winning the Carlton Award for International Animation at The Indies in 2000.

He then directed Robbie the Reindeer in 1999 for BBC Animation Unit. Robbie went on to win 19 international awards including a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award (BAFTA). Following the success of Robbie, Starzak worked for two years on a project for Aardman’s feature film department as well as directing and writing the second series of Rex the Runt. In 2002, Starzak was honoured with the Award for Best TV Special for Robbie the Reindeer: Hooves of Fire at the 3rd International Festival of Animated Feature Films and TV Specials. From 2003, he directed two series of Creature Comforts – 2x13 episodes for ITV based on the Academy Award winning Nick Park short film. The first series went on to win 17 awards, and both series were nominated for a BAFTA. The second series includes a half-hour Christmas special. In between these two series, he devised Shaun the Sheep,[9] writing and directing the pilot.

He is the oldest of three children, and as a youth he enjoyed playing sports, rock climbing, paintballing, and exploring the Sonoran desert. In high school, football became Parker''s main focus. As a sophomore he started on the Varsity team, and by senior year he was captain. Parker first took the stage as a junior in high school as part of a one act play; that is if you don''t count the mandatory theater class in middle school, or the time that he rapped Dr. Dre''s "Forgot About Dre" in the 5th grade talent show. The one act play that he was a part of took first place out of three student written plays at the school''s "one act play competition." The victory was small and seemingly insignificant, but it was enough to inspire Parker to "give this acting thing a shot." With the encouragement of his drama teacher, Parker decided to take acting more seriously, and thus his senior year became a whirlwind of preparing for college while juggling theater and football. Upon graduation Parker packed his bags and headed to Los Angeles for college. But when he got to LA he decided to drop out of school before he even started and dove head first into the entertainment industry; in other words headshots, acting class, and background work. Parker''s break came when he booked the role of "Ryan Shay" on ABC''s hit show Suburgatory, the hyperactive jock neighbor to Jeremy Sisto, and son of Ana Gasteyer and Chris Parnell. Following Suburgatory, Parker became a lead in the critically acclaimed Fox comedy, Enlisted, as the youngest of 3 brothers (Geoff Stultz and Chris Lowell) who are all soldiers in the US Army. In the film world, Parker starred in the Flower Films produced "Animal" and the upcoming indie "Fourth Man Out." Parker resides in Los Angeles and enjoys staying active in a variety of different ways including rock climbing, Krav Maga, yoga, and camping.

Career

Orrantia began singing at the age of nine and began professionally training at the age of 12. She wrote her first song at 13 and by age 14 had recorded her first EP of cover songs. That same year, she began writing with songwriter Jamie Houston who at the time was best known for writing hits for the three of the Disney High School Musical movies. Orrantia recorded the vocals to Houston''s "Magic of a Friend" which was on Disney''s Tinkerbell and The Lost Treasure soundtrack in 2010.

Although she originally auditioned as a solo artist, during "Hollywood Week", she and three other female singers, were put into a group for the rest of the auditions. They were eliminated during the fifth week in the live shows.

Since 2013, Orrantia has played Erica Goldberg on the ABC comedy series The Goldbergs. After casting Orrantia and learning of her singing talent, series creator Adam F. Goldberg has written several episodes where Erica sings and plans to continue to highlight her singing talent in future episodes.

Son père est pasteur de l''église presbytérienne et le jeune Woodrow reçoit une éducation fortement imprégnée de ces croyances ; il est aussi marqué par ses souvenirs de la Guerre de Sécession et les désastres qu’elle a entraînés. À 19 ans, il entre à l''université de Princeton puis commence des études de droit. Il s''installe en tant qu''avocat mais au bout d''un an il reprend ses études et se tourne vers l''histoire et les sciences politiques. Il présente sa thèse de doctorat à 30 ans ; une analyse en faveur d''un plus grand pouvoir de l''exécutif au sein du gouvernement central qui devint un classique des études en sciences politiques. Influencé par des théoriciens britanniques comme Edmond Burke, Wilson est un libéral nostalgique de la pureté démocratique des premières années de la République. Il se destine à une carrière de professeur d''histoire mais rêve de s''engager en politique. En 1902, il devient président de l''université de Princeton et se lance dans une vaste réforme du système d''enseignement.  Le Parti démocrate le contacte en 1910 et le présente en tant que candidat au poste de gouverneur de l''État du New-Jersey. Il est élu et, en à peine un an, se lance dans une réforme des lois électorales, désignation des candidats par des élections primaires directes, afin d’empêcher les machinations politiques. Il se fait rapidement remarquer par les chefs du parti au niveau national et réussit à se faire désigner candidat du Parti démocrate en 1912. Son colistier est un gouverneur de l''Indiana dont la notoriété reste désormais liée à cette remarque : « la seule chose dont ce pays a besoin, c''est d''un bon cigare à 5 cents ».  Sa campagne électorale est basée sur l''élimination des conglomérats industriels, la création d''un impôt fédéral sur le revenu et des élections sénatoriales au suffrage universel. Il s''oppose ainsi àTheodore Roosevelt qui est partisan d''un pouvoir présidentiel fort, garant des libertés, alors qu''il défend la concurrence comme facteur d''équilibre.  L’élection présidentielle de 1912 est une vraie triangulaire entre le candidat du Parti démocrate, le président sortant et candidat du Parti républicain et enfin Theodore Roosevelt qui fonde son propre Parti progressiste quand il ne peut obtenir la nomination du Parti républicain. Woodrow Wilson est élu grâce à la division au sein du Parti républicain ; le total des votes de Taft et de Roosevelt est en effet supérieur à celui obtenu par Wilson1.', 'Staunton', 1, '/mwqso4nME0NFPb0Vhvq8BNffjk9.jpg'),

Eline also starred in the comedy film “Stoner Express”, also in 2016.

Eline is the daughter of the famous Belgian pharmacologist, Rudi Pauwels and his wife Carine Claeys; her father is best known to the world for launching biotech companies, Tibotec and Vicro, both focused on bringing the HIV virus to a controlled state. Eline has a brother, but his identity remains unknown to the public. Elin fell in love with acting at a young age, and in high school appeared in several school plays, which gave her enough experience to study acting once she completed her high school education. She enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, (RADA) London and earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in acting, with special skills in ballet, hip hop, singing, Flamenco and violin. Furthermore, Eline is proficient in Dutch, French and English languages, including American, South American, Irish and Estuary accents.

She started her career in a short student film For Elsie, where she played the role of Mila, a mobster''s daughter who wants to learn the piano in one day. Her performance earned awards from the Beijing Student Film Festival and the Student Academy Awards, USA.  Also at the 39th Annual Student Academy Awards in 2012, For Elsie earned its director David Winstone the Foreign Film Gold Medal.

In 2012, she had a small role (Angelique) in Quartet, Dustin Hoffman''s directorial debut.

In 2014, she played the title role in the Italian drama film Anita B. directed by Roberto Faenza. The 2014 Capri, Hollywood International Film Festival named Powell as that year''s "Breakout" actress for her role in Anita B.. Hollywood Reporter, on the other hand, criticized that performance as "ineffective..failing to convey any traces of the suffering her character has obviously endured."

In 2016, she appeared in two episodes of Game of Thrones as Bianca, a young actress plotting to murder her rival.

She had small roles in Novitiate and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, both released in 2017.

In August 2016, Powell was cast to star in the Freeform series Siren playing Ryn, a feral mermaid who comes to a small coastal village in search of her sister.  Preparing for the role, Powell studied legends of mermaids and sea creatures.  To develop ideas for the mermaid''s body language, Powell worked from videos of marine and other predators.[20][4][21] For the mermaid''s newly learned speech, Powell was inspired by the accent of Icelandic singer Björk.

Siren, which was the top new cable drama during spring 2018, was renewed in October for a second season, premiering on January 24, 2019.', 'Lovanio, Belgio', 4, '/uSNpUtmn8HULtwuEPnb3ogx4jcx.jpg'),

William Benedict (April 16, 1917 – November 25, 1999) was an American actor, perhaps best known for playing "Whitey" in Monogram Pictures'' The Bowery Boys series.

Born in Haskell, Oklahoma, he took part in school theatricals, and on leaving school he made his way to Hollywood. His first film was $10 Raise (1935) starring Edward Everett Horton, which launched Benedict on a busy career. The blond-haired Benedict almost always played juvenile roles, such as newsboys, messengers, office boys, and farmhands.

In 1939, when Universal Pictures began its Little Tough Guys series to compete with the popular Dead End Kids features, Billy Benedict was recruited into the cast. These films led him into the similar East Side Kids movies (usually playing a member of the East Side gang, but occasionally in villainous roles). The East Side Kids became The Bowery Boys in 1946, and Benedict stayed with the series (as "Whitey") through the end of 1951.

Other films included My Little Chickadee (1940) starring W. C. Fields and Mae West, The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), Ed Wood''s Bride of the Monster (1955), The Sting (1973) and Farewell, My Lovely (1975). Benedict never shook his juvenile image completely, and continued to play messengers and news vendors well into his sixties.

At age 12 he played lead in the coming of age short film Waltham Vanguard (2012) which won a CINE Golden Eagle.

Ethel Clayton (November 8, 1882 — June 6, 1966) was an American actress of the silent film era.

Clayton''s screen debut came in 1909, in a short called Justified. She jockeyed her early film appearances with a burgeoning stage career. Her pretty blond looks were reminiscent of the famous Gibson Girl drawings by Charles Dana Gibson. On the stage she appeared mainly in musicals or musical reviews such as The Ziegfeld Follies of 1911. These musical appearances indicate a singing talent Clayton may have possessed but went unused in her many silent screen performances.

In 1912 she appeared in "The Country Boy" on stage at the Lyceum Theatre in Rochester New York and made her feature length film debut in For the Love of a Girl. The film was directed by Barry O''Neil. She was cast with Harry Myers, Charles Arthur, and Peter Lang. She was also directed by William Demille, Robert G. Vignola, George Melford, Donald Crisp, Dallas M. Fitzgerald, and Clifford Sanforth. Like many silent film actors Clayton''s career was hurt by the coming of sound to motion pictures. She continued her career in small parts in movies until she retired in 1948. Her screen credits number more than 180.

Clayton was first married to actor-director Joseph Kaufman until his death in 1918 in the Spanish Influenza epidemic. She later married silent film actor and former star Ian Keith twice and they divorced twice. In both cases Clayton cited cruelty and excessive drinking. Clayton and Keith were first married in Minneapolis in 1928 and first separated on January 13, 1931.

Ethel Clayton died on June 6, 1966 at St. John''s Hospital in Oxnard, California, aged 83. She was buried at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura, California.

For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Ethel Clayton has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.', 'Champaign - Illinois - USA', 1, '/jMjCYkhLcNBrVxJJUwm0PnRJgL0.jpg'),

Originally from the small town of Waynesboro, MS, Angela was always very involved in the arts through years of dance, piano, and clarinet training. In high school, she enjoyed participating in the drama club and was director of the school''s play during her senior year. Angela went on to attend the University of Southern Mississippi where she received a Bachelor''s Degree in Polymer Science and a minor in Chemistry. She then moved to Jackson, TN and worked as a paint chemist, pharmaceutical sales representative, and later became a licensed realtor. In 2009, she met Bobby Kerecz, who was the lead singer for Chippendales at the time. A relationship soon turned into a marriage to Bobby on 10-10-10 on the beach in Hawaii. Bobby, a true entertainer at heart, reawakened the performer side of Angela, and they began pursuing an acting career together. Angela''s first gig was as a featured extra on the TV show, "Nashville", which films in Tennessee. Being on a big set was a stimulus for Angela to know this was what she wanted to pursue. She used her analytical skills to study the business and develop her acting. Angela began to get noticed, and was offered a featured spot in a scene with Arnold Schwarzenegger for the film, "Sabotage", and was featured in the opening scene of "Scary Movie 5". She was also given a recurring feature as a waitress for 23 episodes of "Nashville." On the set of "Last Vegas", she was given some personal advice by Morgan Freeman, one of her favorite actors and a fellow Mississippian, who told her, "Every job is your last one until you get the next one." Inspired to keep following her dreams and work hard, she soon began acting in several independent films, where she landed strong supporting and lead roles in films such as "Shark Exorcist", "Hope", "The Cellular Effect" and many more which would help her move to the next level in her acting. Recently, Angela was in LA working where she had a supporting role in the film "One More Round", which stars Kevin Sorbo, among others. Angela is a diverse actress who has been cast in roles ranging from lawyer, counselor, seductress, mom, to the lead as a female superhero in a web series. Angela also does occasional modeling and commercial work. Together with her husband, Bobby, they wrote and produced "Souls Collide" - a short which they filmed in 2013. "Souls Collide" also gave Angela the opportunity to put her director''s hat back on, which she truly enjoyed. This project then became the launch pad to the screenplay they have just written, "S.O.U.L.", a bio-pic of how they met and struggles they have faced - a story of Searching, Obsessions, Understanding, and Love - a story of redemption. "S.O.U.L." is in pre-production, and Angela and Bobby will star as themselves in this very personal project.  - IMDb Mini Biography By: 7 Souls Productions', NULL, 1, NULL),

Some would say it''s because William broke the mold, but that''s impossible to confirm. He took to acting at a young age, playing the role of the ethereal Santa Claus in his Grade Primary Christmas Concert. Will spent eight weeks with a dialect coach developing his German accent for the part. Four years later he had the most lines in the musical Shortstop in which he played the calculated Carlton. Time constraints allowed only two days of baseball training, but Will proved to be a natural. The next year Will played a rapping toucan. He then closed-out his Elementary School acting career the way he began; again playing the white-bearded giver of joy at his Grade Six Christmas Concert.

Will then took a break from acting to concentrate on his first love of playing the tuba. He got back in the swing of acting in High School, having one line in West Side Story, where he underwent an immense prosthetic and make-up procedure to play a Puerto Rican. From there, Will worked at a video store for some years while making short films with his friends to satiate his acting appetite. After becoming bored with movie-making and clam-baking, Will set his sights for the West Coast and the (occasional) sun of Vancouver, where he attended Vancouver Film School. Upon graduating (with honours), Will found his agent and started his professional career with a shot of the back of his head in I Love You Beth Cooper. From there he appeared in the Emmy-Nominated web series Battlestar Galactica: The Face of the Enemy. He then watched his friends blast off into space in the ABC/CTV/BBC series Defying Gravity.

Will''s latest series is CBC''s Men With Brooms, based on the Paul Gross film of the same name. Will plays the dim-witted, but kind-hearted Curler, Matt.

Among his many mementos  are a sheaf of rejection slips from The New Yorker and Playboy. He was  introduced to the theatre by volunteering to design the set for a  friend''s student production. He worked on the art staff of the OSU  Motion Pictures Department and the University TV station, WOSU. In 1963,  after the usual summer stock assignments, he arrived in New York City,  where he worked at NBC as a page and as a production assistant. He  became a backstage jack-of-all-trades with The New York Shakespeare  Festival, The Playhouse of the Ridiculous, and many other regional and  off-Broadway theater groups.

In 1966 he was hired by Peter  Schickele as the stage manager for PDQ Bach, and became known to  thousands of concert goers in New York and around the country as the  irascible and irritable but always efficient apologist for Schickele''s  satiric presentations of the infamous "Evening of Musical Madness".  Despite his crusty on-stage persona, Bill was for 46 years the technical  coordinator, production manager, road manager, and the REAL stage  manager of the series of concerts that had its first public performance  in 1965 at Town Hall in New York. He once said that he felt like Sky  Masterson, the gambler-hero of "Guys and Dolls", who noted that: "There  are two things that have been in every hotel room in America: Sky  Masterson and the Gideon Bible."

Walters continues to work in  concerts, theatre, dabbles in background work in movies and TV, writes  lots of unproduced plays and film scripts, and teaches film-making and  video with kids. He also works for Gray Line New York Sightseeing as a  tour guide riding around on the top of a double-decker bus telling lies  about New York City to gullible and unwary tourists.

Nikos has two older sisters, Anna and Julia. Since Nikos was a child, it was obvious that he is multi-talented. His first contact with acting was at the age of 9, as an active member of the acting group of his primary school. One of the most hilarious moments of his life happened when he was a student at the 5th class of the primary school. While he was performing in a theater play, he forgot his script and he created his own new dialogues! This situation socked and confused the other students- actors, though he made the audience laughing out loudly watching him acting so naturally out of the script. By this fact, everyone understood that he has a really bright future on acting. Few years later, he participated in a Pan-Hellenic music competition as the primary singer of the chorus of Syros and he awarded with the first prize. He graduated as the best student of his year from the University of Larissa, Greece from the Department of Medical Laboratories. The duration of these studies is 4 years, but due to the fact that he was an excellent student, he graduated in 3 years with the highest mark. We should also notice that he was the youngest student who has been graduated the Department of Medical Laboratories. Moreover, he took a scholarship to study in the Department of Medicine. Even if this is the dream for many students, Nikos had different personal ambitions. So, he studied in a Drama School named "The Theater Of Changes", hiding from his family that he dropped out the Medicine School. Only few months after his first steps as a student in the drama school, he took part in his first TV serial, named "The generation of 592 EUR". Shortly after completing this participation in the serial, he continued to take part in various TV series and films. His last work in Greece was in the daily serial "Stolen Dreams" on Mega Channel, as Lefterakis. During this running project, he received an offer from the Turkish production company ADAM film to take part in the TV serial "Two sides and One Ismail" on ATV Channel in Turkey. This was a really big opportunity for him to achieve his ambitions, but on the other hand was such a big challenge. He had the opportunity to discover the Turkish culture and the different ways of working at this well-promising film industry. Without doubt, it was a challenging move, with many risks, to act in a language that he couldn''t speak or read. Although, he took the decision to accept this offer and he relocated to Ayvalik in Turkey, as here was the basic place of the shootings. By the end of that serial he took part in a short film named "Lack". Noticing that he was the only actor in this movie, he awarded with two prizes in two famous film festivals in Turkey. Then, he took part in an American film named "Two faces of January" with Viggo Mortensen , Kirsten Dunst and Oscar Isaac. With multiple projects currently filming or in the production phases, Nikos continues to move forward in his career and look ahead for new opportunities.  - IMDb Mini Biography By: Nikos Mavrakis', 'Ermoupoli, Syros, Greece', 1, '/av7Rzm5ZLOzSpRLHxK3Td9AtKrC.jpg'),

Alma Rubens (February 19, 1897 – January 22, 1931) was an American film actress and stage performer. Rubens began her career in the mid 1910s. She quickly rose to stardom in 1916 after appearing opposite Douglas Fairbanks in The Half Breed. For the remainder of the decade, she appeared in supporting roles in comedies and drama. In the 1920s. Her first stage opportunity came when a chorus girl in a musical comedy theater troupe became ill. Rubens was chosen to take her place and joined the troupe as a regular performer. There she met Franklyn Farnum who was also a member. He later convinced Rubens to leave the troupe and try her hand at film acting. Her breakthrough performance was in 1916 in the movie Reggie Mixes In. She made six more films in that same year. In 1917 she starred in The Firefly of Tough Luck, which was a big success. She gained fame when she became Douglas Fairbanks''s leading lady in The Half Breed (1916), and supported Fairbanks and Bessie Love in the cocaine comedy The Mystery of the Leaping Fish later that same year. In 1918, Alma announced that she was changing the spelling of her last name of Rueben to "Rubens" because it caused too much confusion in the movie industry and in publications. She later told Photoplay magazine, "As a matter of fact my name is not the same [spelling] as the painter''s. It''s either Reubens or Ruebens-I forget which. I never could spell it. Couldn''t remember where the ''e'' came. So I let it go Rubens." In 1920, she completed The World and His Wife, opposite Montague Love which further solidified her popularity. In 1924, she starred in The Price She Paid and Cytherea.  Rubens developed a drug addiction which eventually ended her career.

Pauline Starke (January 10, 1901 – February 3, 1977) was an American silent-film actress born in Joplin, Missouri.

She made her acting debut appearing as a dance extra in D.W. Griffith''s film Intolerance (1916). She continued to play bit parts until director Frank Borzage started casting her in leading roles, beginning in 1917.

Selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1922, Starke starred in a number of films from 1916 to 1935. She had been introduced into the film industry by a friend following the completion of her education.

She scored several lead roles in films, establishing her as a prominent silent-film actress during the 1920s.

She married twice in her lifetime. She first married producer/director Jack White in 1927 and later married actor George Sherwood.

She died from the aftermath of a stroke on February 3, 1977 in Santa Monica, California. Pauline Starke has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6125 Hollywood Blvd, for her contributions

Her great-uncle was actor and playwright Arnold Ridley, of Dad''s Army fame. She attended Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire, graduating in 2010 at the age of 18.

Ridley has appeared in the television programmes Youngers, Silent Witness, Mr Selfridge and Casualty. She also appeared in the short film Blue Season, which was entered into the Sci-Fi-London 48-Hour Film Challenge. She played the lead in film three of Lifesaver, an interactive film which was nominated for a BAFTA British Academy Award. She has also appeared in the music video for Wiley''s song "Lights On".

In April 2014, it was announced that she will play Rey, one of the lead characters in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. She was chosen for the film in February 2014. The casting of Ridley has generally been seen as a deliberate move from director J. J. Abrams, as he wishes to repeat the casting of relatively unknown actors for the lead roles like George Lucas did with the first Star Wars film in 1977.

After receiving several competing offers, Ridley switched from her original talent agency Jonathan Arun to the United Talent Agency in August 2014.

Isabelle''s natural charm and beauty propelled her into the world of acting and modeling at the tender age of 17. Before long, she was hired for a series of commercials and she guest starred on several TV Shows. Isabelle''s acting career began with a bang when she was handpicked from a crowd of over 500 teenagers to roller-blade in a McDonald''s commercial. When Isabelle was 19, a talent scout selected her for a three-month modeling stint in Japan and later on in Spain. Although most of the assignments were print work, Isabelle spent one memorable week riding motorcycles for Kawasaki near Mount Fuji in Japan. Isabelle has always been a girl on the go. She loves yoga, soccer, swimming, rock climbing, skating, snorkeling, and dancing. She developed her team spirit through gymnastics and volleyball games. When Isabelle was in her early 20s, her parents divorced. A few years later, while she was completing a university degree, her estranged father developed cancer. Isabelle dedicated herself to nursing her ailing father. Education has always been a priority in her agenda. After a brief foray in science with a view to pursue veterinary studies, Isabelle took some courses in scriptwriting at Quebec University. Then she decided to pursue this passion and completed her BA in Communications Studies at Concordia University in Montreal. Isabelle further developed her interest in film by working as an assistant to her mentor Father Marc Gervais, a film analysis teacher, author and judge at the Cannes Film Festival. Next, she attended, The International Film and Video workshops in Rockport, Maine, USA. Three weeks after her arrival, Isabelle was offered an assistant teaching position. Shortly thereafter, she went to Los Angeles to study script analysis and acting with Judith Weston. In 2002, she acted and danced in "The Best of Billy Joel" music video, which appeared in Canada and the USA. She has been attending Warren Robertson theater workshops since 2002. In addition to acting, Isabelle is also interested in other facets of the entertainment industry. She has worked in casting for children''s television shows (Caillou for PBS). And Isabelle has written, directed and produced documentaries, corporate videos, short films and a music video "Red light". She also is an assistant and location manager for photographers, TV Shows and films.

So she did...and she made the squad! Sparking her love of dance and performing. After graduating from high school, Vivian continued performing through dance as an NFL Football Cheerleader for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for 4 years. Both experiences were precursors to her acting career. Vivian has held her own in many industries and has earned the admiration and respect of her family, friends and peers alike.

Legacy has always ran strong in his family. Beginning with his name. His father Troy garnered his name through his father''s love of Greek and Roman history and mythology. He continued this tradition with his own children, Marcus and his sister Athena. At age 10, when Marcus booked his first big guest star on the television show "Castle" he celebrated by getting his first puppy, a feisty beagle, he named Zeus.

In September 2014, he landed his first series regular playing Andre Jr on ABC''s "black-ish." The show went on to become the highest rated new comedy of the season.

Marcus has garnered an NAACP Image Award for the show. And it has been honored with the prestigious "Peabody Award," multiple "NAACP" Awards, and "Emmy" nominations.

He has always loved animation. It was his dream come true to the rambunctious dinosaur Buck in Pixar''s "The Good Dinosaur." And to become a part of the DreamWorks family in the animated series "Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh" airing on Netflix.

Always the proponent for a positive message, he is excited to be one of the leads in the upcoming feature in the upcoming teen feature "Alexander IRL."

On his hiatus, Marcus can be found traveling the globe doing humanitarian work. The Beaches Resorts and Sandals Foundation just named him their first Youth Ambassador. He has visited several islands in the Caribbean helping to bring a higher education to children. He is also the Chief Youth Innovator for Reserve Protection Agency in South Africa who help to protect Africa''s beautiful animals.

An honor student, he is working diligently towards his dream of attending one of the great Pac-12 Universities. Stanford and UCLA being his top choice.', 'Los Angeles, California, USA', 1, '/viJMaVFJE5QjMDrv5lee47e6lxG.jpg'),

A first-dan black belt in Hapkido and TaeKwonDo with a specialty in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai and Mixed Martial Arts, Manel has been an aspiring martial artist since the age of 11.

For ten years of his life, Manel''s training eventually led him in the company of some very important people, working various types of jobs protecting people, from bouncer to personal bodyguard, until one day he decided it was no longer for him. Eventually, he sold his car and flew to Thailand to pursue a career in competitive fighting, where his career would have remained lucrative until a near-deadly incident with a greedy, machete-wielding cab driver nearly took his life in 2009. And although Manel prevailed, his injuries cost him his fighting career.

As time passed with recovery, Manel had the good fortune of bumping into Jaika Stunts founder, veteran stunt performer and stunt coordinator Kaecha Kampakdee, whose most notable stunt and choreography credits include Daniel Bernhardt''s acting debut - Bloodsport 2, Tony Jaa''s sequelized epic thriller, Ong Bak 2 and Bollywood actor Allu Arjun''s Iddaramayilatho. And upon his crossing of paths with Kampakdee, the rest would soon fall into place, with Manel working on a number of films doing stunt work and other small acting roles, including Iddaramayilatho and the comedic Hollywood hit, The Hangover 2 directed by Todd Philips, to name a few.

As of 2015, Manel is currently working on what he hopes to be his first-ever feature lead role based on the previously-shot shortfilm, Portrait Of An Angry Man, shot by cinematographer Kimbo Kim and Italian writer/director Joe Petrosino. Filmed about four years ago, Manel strongly considers Portrait Of An Angry Man, a "lovely experience" that fully embedded him as an actor. "Without a doubt, I can say that this is the project that made me fall in love with acting and film making as I was involved all the way from the start to finish."he says. "It is what made me realize how beautiful it really is to make a movie, or shortfilm in this case." Manel Soler will also be seen in the upcoming film, A Man Will Rise, which is still pending release. In addition, Manel Soler has worked with stunt coordinator Brett Chan on actor Nicholas Cage''s 12th century romantic war epic, Outcast, with co-stars Hayden Christensen (Star Wars Episode 2 & 3, Jumper) and Crystial Liu (The Forbidden Kingdom, The Four) under veteran stunt coordinator Nick Powell (The Last Samurai, The Three Musketeers) making his directorial debut. Manel has also worked with Tony Jaa (Ong Bak Trilogy, Fast & Furious 7) and veteran actors and martial artist Dolph Lundgren (Expendables trilogy, Universal Soldier, Rocky IV), Michel Jai White (The Dark Knight, Spawn, Blood and Bone) and Golden Globe winer Ron Perlman (Hellboy 1,2, Drive) in the 2015 action thriller, Skin Trade.

On another, more personal note, Manel Soler has expressed his own fortitude, looking back on his life with resolve with the philosophy that everything that happened, from body-guarding and security, to an incident that nearly cost him his life, has happened for a reason.

She has had not one, but two recurring roles as a nanny - on 1999''s NBC remake ''Cold Feet'' and on the upcoming ''Girlfriend''s Guide to Divorce'', Bravo TV''s first even scripted series.

This year Maria had the opportunity to perform her one-woman stage play (in her native Portuguese and English) in the middle of the Atlantic at the ''Azores International Fringe Festival''.

Because of her athletic abilities, she ended up auditioning with thousands of girls for WOW (Women of Wrestling) TV series that aired in 2000. She booked a role as a good guy but refused unless she became a heel (bad guy). After approval, she became "Delta Lotta Pain", a member of the Tag Team "Caged Heat" along with Cher Ferrerya ("Loca") and Nicole Ochoa ("Vendetta"). In 2000, Jwaundace and her partners in Caged Heat became WOW''s 1st Tag Team Champions becoming WOW''s most popular Tag Team in history.

Because of much exposure, Jwaundace was recruited into the stunt world. She was approached to be a stunt double for Queen Latifah in "Bringing Down the House". That fight scene she did for Queen Latifah earned her a "Best Fight" nomination at the MTV Movie Awards in 2004. After that, Jwaundace decided to perform more stunt work to gain recognition to transfer into acting.

After performing in over 75 filming and TV shows, performing stunts for Oscar and Emmy nominated and winning actresses such as Viola Davis, Mo''Nique, Jennifer Hudson, Queen Latifah, Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, etc., she moved back to Atlanta in 2010 to give birth and raise her son. While in Atlanta, she shifted her focus on stunts to acting booking roles on "Banshee", "Conan", "Let''s Stay Together", and recurring roles on ABC''s "Resurrection" as Mrs. Camille Thompson (mom to Omar Epps). She got the most recognition in her debut film, 20th Century Fox''s "Let''s Be Cops". She ad-libbed the line ''That''s What You Get'', while filming. The director, Luke Greenfield, and writer, Nicholas Thomas, decided to keep it in the scene and it paid off by being a major part of their marketing campaign.
