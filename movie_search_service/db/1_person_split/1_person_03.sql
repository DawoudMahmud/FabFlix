An aspiring model, 16-year-old Bo Derek was introduced to actor/director/cinematographer John Derek in 1971. Just as he''d done with previous "protegés" Ursula Andress and Linda Evans, Derek literally molded her into a highly desirable superstar. In 1974, the 48-year-old Derek capped his makeover by marrying the 18-year-old Bo. In her first film, the Jaws rip-off Orca, Bo showed up long enough to have her lovely leg chewed off by a killer whale. Her next film was far more rewarding: Blake Edwards'' 10 (1979), in which, bouncing along the beach in slow motion to the pulsating rhythms of Ravel''s Bolero, the scantily clad, cornrow-coifed Bo became the instant object of star Dudley Moore''s affections. An overnight pinup favorite, Bo followed her 10 triumph with a brace of adventure films directed by her husband: Tarzan the Ape Man (1981) and Bolero (1984). After six years away from films, she returned before the cameras in another Derek/Derek co-production, the unsuccessful Ghosts Can''t Do It (1990). Bo Derek has since occasionally appeared in such films as the Italian Sognando La California (1991) and the American Woman of Desire (1994). Derek also appeared in Tommy Boy the 1995 comedy starring  David Spade and Chris Farley.

In 2003, Derek played the mother of a sheltered wannabe named B-Rad (Jamie Kennedy), and joined the Miss Universe 2004 pageant as a judge. The actress appeared in several television series including 7th Heaven, Lucky, and Queen of Swords. In 2006, she took a leading role as a ruthless businesswoman in Fashion House, a telenovela drama series following the scandals and passions found within an elite corporation.

When not acting, Bo Derek participates in a number of political and social causes, including working on the behalves of disabeled veterans, serving as a spokeswoman for the Animal Welfare Institute’s campaign to put an end to the slaughter of horses. Derek is an avid equestrian and published an autobiography titled Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi', 'Long Beach, California, USA', 2, '/7WI05Puq8rxZKjXK7nMp82LoNNY.jpg'),

Almada was born in Huatabampo, Sonora. Apart from acting he was also a director, writer and film producer. He began his artistic career in Mexico during the 1930s. He has appeared in over 200 films, with his first being Madre Querida in 1935. In this film he acted alongside his brother Fernando as children as an extra. He would not appear in another film again until a few decades later.

Almada moved from his home city of Huatabampo to Ciudad Obregón and to Guadalajara, Jalisco, where he lived for many years until he settled down in Mexico City. Almada was born to a family connected to the film industry, and was exposed to film shootings from an early age and, when he moved to Mexico City, he began working at a nightclub called Cabaret Master that was owned by his father.

When his brother Fernando decided to take up acting, Mario decided to become a film producer. He wrote his first film script in 1963. The Almada brothers had their own family-run production company that eventually dissolved due to financial troubles from lack of profit.

All his films are made in Australia with predominantly Australian casts. He has made only three films in two decades, yet they have been some of the most critically acclaimed works in Australian cinema during that time. He is famous for his insistence on "complete creative control", one-take shoots and use of natural light. He makes commercials in between films.

Lawrence''s unique cinematic style has established him as one of the most respected dramatic directors of contemporary Australian cinema. While only producing three films in his 25 year career as a feature film director, all of his features have meditated around the slippery and often painful nature of ''real'' human interaction. It is Lawrence''s ability to illustrate intensely personal interactions between characters as they navigate through the less than ''cinematic'' terrain of real life situations that has engaged his audience and earned the respect among cinema goers and critics alike.

His second feature, Lantana (2001), is one of the highest grossing Australian films ever made winning critical and popular recognition including Best film, Australian Film Institute (AFI) Awards. Examining the notion of trust, the film weaves the mysterious disappearance of a wealthy psychiatrist across the fabric of three Australian families, with each family representative of a different social class existent in contemporary Australian society.

Tamara Taylor (born September 27, 1970, height 5'' 6½" (1,69 m)) is a Canadian television actress.

Born in Toronto to a black Canadian father and a Scottish Canadian mother, her most famous role is that of Dr. Camille Saroyan, head of the Forensic Division, on the forensic crime drama Bones. She also appeared in the CBS medical drama 3 lbs as Della and the UPN series Sex, Love & Secrets in the role of Nina, both of which were short-lived.

Taylor has made guest appearances on NCIS, Numb3rs, Lost, CSI: Miami, Without a Trace, Party of Five and Dawson''s Creek. She portrayed Debrah Simmons in the 2005 romantic-comedy Diary of a Mad Black Woman. Taylor also had a brief role in Serenity, the movie conclusion of the TV series Firefly by Joss Whedon. Through her part in Serenity, Taylor was able to audition for a show with actor David Boreanaz, who had previously worked with Whedon in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. She also appeared in the TV series Lost, as the former girlfriend of Michael and mother of Walt.

She first appeared in Bones in the first episode of the second season, "The Titan On The Tracks," portraying the character Dr. Camille Saroyan. In the first six episodes of the season, she was credited as "Guest Starring" because creator and writer Hart Hanson had planned to kill her in episode six when Howard Epps, a recurring serial killer, poisoned her in order to create more tension and drama between the two main characters. However, the response to Cam was so strong that the writers offered her a position as a recurring regular in the show. Thus, in episode 7, "The Girl With The Curl," she was credited as a main character of the series and appeared in the title sequence.', '	Toronto, Ontario, Canada', 1, '/xmWWuOtEpeQP3ITTxqt4hTQesgh.jpg'),

Hugh O''Brian (born April 19, 1925) was an American actor, known for his starring role in the ABC television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1955–1961).

 "Wyatt Earp" remained a Top 20 hit until 1960, but it was canceled the following year after being supplanted by the avalanche of other adult Westerns.  O''Brian, meanwhile, continued to work frequently in movies, television and theater through the 1990s, although he never again achieved the prominence he enjoyed as Wyatt Earp.  He starred in the 1970s detective series "Search" and appeared in such films as "In Harm''s Way" and "Ten Little Indians," and reprised his role as Earp in 1994''s "Wyatt Earp: Return to Tombstone," a film that combined new footage with colorized scenes from the original black-and-white TV show.  He also had a small but memorable role as the faro dealer in John Wayne''s last film, "The Shootist," and later noted with pride that it gave him the distinction of being the last bad guy killed by Wayne. (Wayne himself is reputed to have met the real Wyatt Earp as a young man in Hollywood in the 1920s.)

Roarke was born Richard Jordan Gerler in Brooklyn, New York, where he was a street gang member during his youth. His father was a vaudeville comedian and his mother was a chorine, showgirl.

Richie, as he was affectionately called by friends, began his acting career under the name Jordan Grant; however, when he signed on with Universal Studios in 1957, he was told that he needed to change the name, because the studios already had one Mr. Grant (Cary Grant, that is) under contract. Roarke appeared in a number of television series during the late 50s and early 60s, including the role of Communications Officer Garrison in the original Star Trek pilot. He appeared in a string of AIP biker pictures along with Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Bruce Dern in the late 1960s, beginning with Hells Angels on Wheels (1967), and culminating with The Losers (subsequently retitled Nam''s Angels) in 1970. In 1974, Roarke appeared in the financially-successful car chase film Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, with Fonda and Susan George, a role which showcased his range of acting skill despite the level of the material.

His "breakout role" came in 1980 when he portrayed Raymond Bailey, a self-important leading man whose stunt double was played by Steve Railsback in The Stunt Man. Peter O’Toole befriended Roarke during filming, and the two became drinking buddies. Unfortunately, Roarke was unable to keep up with O’Toole, and was hospitalized with delirium tremens before shooting was concluded. Word spread around Hollywood quickly, and Roarke had difficulty finding work as a result. However, an offer to work on a low-budget independent film brought him to Austin, Texas in 1982. At the time, Texas had a burgeoning movie industry—billing itself as the "Third Coast"—but lacked any real opportunities for aspiring film actors to learn their craft from industry veterans. Recognizing this need, Roarke opened the "Film Actors Lab" in the Dallas Communications Complex at the Studios in Las Colinas. "Graduates" of his program include Darryl Cox, Benton Jennings, Lar Park Lincoln and Lou Diamond Phillips.

In 1989, Roarke married Carla DeLane, and they had one child together. A child from Roarke’s previous marriage, Jordan Gerler, was also an actor, appearing in Rolling Tunder in 1987. Roarke died in Euless, Texas of an apparent heart attack.

Jean Martin (March 6, 1922 – February 2, 2009) was a French actor of stage and screen. Martin served in the French Resistance during World War II and later fought with the French paratroopers in Indochina. Theatrically, he is perhaps best-known for originating two roles in Samuel Beckett''s most famous plays: Lucky in Waiting for Godot, and Clov in Endgame. During the 1950s, he was a performer at the Théâtre National Populaire and also worked for radio plays.

Making over eighty film and television appearances, Martin is best remembered by international audiences for his role as the French paratroop commander Col. Mathieu in The Battle of Algiers (1965), as well as villainous roles in My Name is Nobody and The Day of the Jackal (both 1973). He was one of the protagonists in Les Compagnons de Baal (1968).

Most of his other screen work was in French or European cinema, and his stage performances have gained him much more recognition and acclaim than his film work. Martin was also an active political leftist, and was fired from the Théâtre National Populaire for signing the manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian War. He was also blacklisted from radio work and remained unemployed for a time as a result.

Martin was hired for The Battle of Algiers because director Gillo Pontecorvo was looking for a little-known professional actor to play the part of Col. Mathieu. Martin had by then worked extensively on stage, but had done just a few appearances on screen. Enjoying to work in movies and wishing to develop his film career, Martin applied for the part and was hired. Martin later explained that his working relationship with Pontecorvo on the set of The Battle of Algiers was often difficult, as the director otherwise hired non-professional actors for the film. Martin, as the film''s only professional actor, was sometimes uncomfortable working with untrained performers, while Pontecorvo was worried that their acting styles might be too different from each other and work against the picture. Martin was ultimately very happy with the film.

Jean Martin continued working on stage and on screen, playing a variety supporting roles in French films and television productions. He also provided the voice of the bird in the French animation feature Le Roi et l''oiseau.

Martin died from cancer in Paris on 2 February 2009, aged 86.

Early post-war credits would include touring with Sir Donald Wolfit and Sir Barry Jackson in their prestigious companies. Favorite roles in his repertoire would eventually include "Macbeth", "King Lear" and "Uncle Vanya". He won London''s Evening Standard Award for "Rosmersholm" in 1959. Joining the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960, he became a prime, esteemed resident for decades. Porter made his film debut in mid-career with The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) at age 36, but it was the BBC that made him an international favorite as the ever-proper but intensely emotional and unhinged "Soames Forsyte".

Sidney Lumet (June 25, 1924 – April 9, 2011) was an American director, producer and screenwriter with over 50 films to his name. He was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Director for 12 Angry Men (1957), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Network (1976) and The Verdict (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, although he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as Network, which was nominated for 10, winning 4.

The Encyclopedia of Hollywood states that Lumet was one of the most prolific directors of the modern era, making more than one movie per year on average since his directorial debut in 1957. He was noted by Turner Classic Movies for his "strong direction of actors", "vigorous storytelling" and the "social realism" in his best work. Film critic Roger Ebert described him as having been "one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors." Lumet was also known as an "actor''s director," having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than "any other director."

Lumet began his career as an Off-Broadway director, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered "problem picture," 12 Angry Men (1957). From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies. In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his "brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture." Two years later, he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama Before the Devil Knows You''re Dead (2007).

His character would often make a statement, only to immediately negate the statement himself and then negate the corrected statement until his stream of statements was interrupted by a frustrated Oliver Wendell Douglas portrayed by Eddie Albert. One such statement was, "Good morning, Mr. Douglas! Well, it''s not a good morning ... but it''s not a bad morning either!"

He became an actor and furthered his training at the Pasadena Playhouse, succeeding David Wayne in the role of Ensign Pulver opposite Henry Fonda''s Mister Roberts on Broadway, and later toured with the play for 14 months. He made his screen debut playing the quartermaster in Okinawa (1952).[4]

Moore appeared in guest and supporting roles in a number of movies and television shows, including "My Little Margie" in 1952, as Dillard Crumbly, an efficiency expert fresh out of Efficiency College, The Mickey Mouse Club, where he hosted "What I Want to Be" segments as the Roving Reporter. He had a small role as a member of Marlon Brando''s motorcycle gang in the 1953 film The Wild One, and a similar bit part the same year as one of the Linda Rosa townspeople in The War of the Worlds. Moore co-starred with Dick Powell and Debbie Reynolds in the 1954 film Susan Slept Here, in which he displayed his natural gift for physical comedy. In 1955 he co-starred with Brian Keith and Kim Novak in 5 Against the House. In the early 1960s he was cast in the recurring role of Howie in 11 episodes of the CBS sitcom Pete and Gladys, with Harry Morgan and Cara Williams.[4]

In 1962 Moore was cast as the Swiss-American botanist David Douglas, for whom the Douglas fir tree is named, in an episode of the western anthology series Death Valley Days. Keenan Wynn co-starred as Douglas'' friend Josh Tavers, and Iron Eyes Cody played an Indian chief who threatens to kill the two men.[6]

Moore made a brief appearance as a cab driver in the 1964 Perry Mason episode "The Case of the Wednesday Woman." He also appeared in two episodes of another CBS sitcom, The Dick Van Dyke Show, "The Impractical Joke" and "The Case Of The Pillow." He was also a guest star on The Andy Griffith Show and later on Little House on the Prairie (TV series). He was an actor, producer, and uncredited scriptwriter for A Boy and His Dog.

One of the most popular and influential stars in America during her lifetime, with one of Hollywood''s longest careers, especially on television, Ball began acting in the 1930s, becoming both a radio actress and B-movie star in the 1940s, and then a television star during the 1950s. She was still making films in the 1960s and 1970s.

Ball received thirteen Emmy Award nominations and four wins. In 1977 Ball was among the first recipients of the Women in Film Crystal Award. She was the recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1979, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Kennedy Center Honors in 1986 and the Governors Award from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences in 1989.

In 1929, Ball landed work as a model and later began her performing career on Broadway using the stage name Dianne Belmont. She appeared in many small movie roles in the 1930s as a contract player for RKO Radio Pictures. Ball was labeled as the "Queen of the Bs" (referring to her many roles in B-films). In 1951, Ball was pivotal in the creation of the television series I Love Lucy. The show co-starred her then husband, Desi Arnaz as Ricky Ricardo and Vivian Vance and William Frawley as Ethel and Fred Mertz, the Ricardos'' landlords and friends. The show ended in 1957 after 180 episodes. They then changed the format a little - lengthening the time of the show from 30 minutes to 60 minutes (the first one went 75 mins), adding some characters, altering the storyline somewhat, and renaming the show from "I Love Lucy" to "The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour", which ran for three seasons (1957–1960) and 13 episodes. Ball went on to star in two more successful television series: The Lucy Show, which ran on CBS from 1962 to 1968 (156 Episodes), and Here''s Lucy from 1968 to 1974 (144 episodes). Her last attempt at a television series was a 1986 show called Life with Lucy - which failed miserably after 8 episodes aired although 13 were produced.

Ball met and eloped with Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz in 1940. On July 17, 1951, almost 40 years old, Ball gave birth to their first child, Lucie Désirée Arnaz. A year and a half later, Ball gave birth to their second child, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV, known as Desi Arnaz, Jr. Ball and Arnaz divorced on May 4, 1960.

On April 26, 1989, Ball died of a dissecting aortic aneurysm at age 77. At the time of her death she had been married to her second husband, standup comedian and business partner Gary Morton, for twenty-eight years.

Born in New York City, Sullivan fell into acting when in college playing semi-pro football. During the later Depression years, Sullivan was told that because of his 6 ft 3 in (1.9 m) stature and rugged good looks he could "make money" simply standing on a Broadway stage. This began a successful career on Broadway, movies and television.

One of Sullivan''s most memorable roles was playing a movie director in The Bad and the Beautiful opposite Kirk Douglas. Sullivan toured the US with Bette Davis in theatrical readings of the poetry of Carl Sandburg and starred opposite her in the 1951 film Payment on Demand. In 1950, Sullivan appeared in the film A Life of Her Own and replaced Vincent Price in the role of Leslie Charteris'' Simon Templar on the NBC Radio show The Saint. Unfortunately, Sullivan only lasted two episodes before the show was cancelled, and then resurrected five weeks later with Vincent Price once again playing the starring role.

Sullivan''s first starring TV show was a syndicated adaptation of the radio series The Man Called X for Ziv Television in 1956-1957, as secret agent Ken Thurston, the role Herbert Marshall originally portrayed before the microphone. In the 1957-1958 season, Sullivan starred in the adventure/drama television series Harbormaster. He played a commercial ship''s captain, David Scott, and Paul Burke played his partner, Jeff Kittridge, in five episodes of the series, which aired first on CBS and then ABC under the revised title Adventure at Scott Island.

In 1960, Sullivan played frontier sheriff Pat Garrett opposite Clu Gulager as outlaw Billy the Kid in the western television series The Tall Man (although the series ran for seventy-five half-hour episodes, the one in which Garrett kills Billy was never filmed). Sullivan appeared in Sam Peckinpah''s Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid (1973) as John Chisum, but his scene was excised from the release print (though later restored to the film). He had a featured role in the 1976 miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man Book II. In additional to The Tall Man, Sullivan also starred in the television series The Road West, which aired on NBC on Monday, alternating with Perry Como), during the 1966-1967 season. Sullivan played the role of family patriarch Ben Pride.

Sullivan guest starred in many series, including The DuPont Show with June Allyson, The Reporter, The Love Boat, Little House on the Prairie, and McMillan and Wife. He starred in many Hallmark Hall of Fame specials including a highly acclaimed production of "The Price" opposite George C. Scott. Sullivan was consistently in demand for the entirety of his career. His acting career spanned romantic leading man roles to villains and finally to character roles. In his later years, Sullivan had roles in the films, Oh God with George Burns and Earthquake, where he shared scenes with Ava Gardner.

Arthur Hindle (born July 21, 1948) is a Canadian actor and director.

Hindle was born in Halifax. His family moved to Toronto while he was a child. Although shy as a youngster, he grew to be a rebellious and independent teenager. This led him to travel, mostly via hitchhiking, while picking up odd jobs and meeting people from varied walks of life.

By the time he was 21, he was a father, a stockbroker and an amateur photographer. Although fairly successful as a broker, he was unfulfilled and eventually, after being inspired and touched by a Toronto Workshop Productions play, he made the commitment to leave the stock market for the theatre. He worked for a few months with TWP and got an acting agent, which led to started auditioning for commercials.

It was at this time that Hindle credits a discovery that changed his future. He was directed to the Eli Rill workshop. Eli Rill had moved to Toronto from New York, where he taught at the Actor’s Studio. At this workshop, Hindle studied Method. He thrived in this environment and soon started applying his knowledge to getting acting jobs. Further inspiration for becoming an actor was his uncle, Michael Kane, with whom Art finally had the opportunity to work in the film "The Gunfighters".

He has made guest appearances in a long list of television programs in North America, and has also appeared in several movies, dating from 1971. His first major role was in a biker movie, "The Proud Rider", spawned by the popularity of Easy Rider. Hindle worked with a real motorcycle gang, Satan’s Choice. It was during the making of this rather bad movie that Art almost changed his professional name to Jeremy Kane. The producers thought that Hindle should have a more showbiz-sounding name. He chose Jeremy Kane (Kane in honor of his uncle), and even though he reverted to his birth name due to urging from his uncle, his "Jeremy Kane" pseudonym is still connected to the film.

The next big step was being cast as Billy Duke, the best hockey player in the world, drafted by the Maple Leafs to lead them back to the playoffs in the film "Face-Off", Canada’s first million-dollar movie. This film led to offers from Hollywood which he resisted until work dried up and Hindle - who had four children by this time - finally moved to Los Angeles.

Over the years, Art has come to be known as a “working actor” involved as a leading actor in some classic films and numerous pilots and series. His work in E.N.G., one of Canada’s most successful series, won him a Gemini. From the early 1990s, Art has also worked as a director.

Hindle is married and divides his time between California and Canada. He currently stars in and directs the popular series Paradise Falls showing on cable stations in the USA and on the Showcase channel in Canada.

The future mother of Mia Farrow was a schooldays classmate of Vivien Leigh at the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton in London. Even as a schoolgirl, Maureen desired an acting career; she studied hard and read widely. When the opportunity to be an actress came along, it almost dropped in her lap. The director Frank Borzage was in Dublin filming “Song o’ My Heart” (1930) when Maureen, then 18, met him. Borzage suggested a screen test, which she took. The results were more than favorable, as she won the part of Eileen O’Brien. The part was a substantial one, so much so that Maureen went on to Hollywood to complete the filming. Once in sunny California, Maureen wasted no time landing roles in other films such as “Just Imagine” (1930), “Princess and the Plumber” (1930), and “So This Is London” (1930). Maureen was on a roll that her contemporaries could only have wished for when they were coming up through the ranks. In 1932, Maureen was teamed up with Olympic medal winner Johnny Weissmuller for the first time in “Tarzan the Ape Man” (1932). Five other Tarzan films followed, the last being “Tarzan’s New York Adventure” (1942). The Tarzan epics rank as one of the most memorable series ever made. Most people agree that those movies would not have been successful had it not been for the fine acting talents, not to mention beauty, of Maureen O’Sullivan. But she was more than Jane Parker in the Tarzan films; she had great roles and played beautifully in films such as “The Flame Within” (1935), “David Copperfield” (1935), and “Anna Karenina” (1935). She turned in yet another fine performance in “Pride and Prejudice” (1940). After the 1940s, Maureen made far fewer films, not because she lost popularity but by choice. It isn’t always easy to walk away from a lucrative career, but she did because she wanted to devote more time to her husband, John Farrow, an Australian writer, and their seven children. The couple were married from 1936 until his death in 1963. She did not, however, retire completely; Maureen still found time to make an occasional appearance in films or TV or on the stage. Later movie-goers remember her as Elizabeth Alvorg in the hit film “Peggy Sue Got Married” (1986). Her final silver screen appearance was in “The River Pirates” (1988). Some TV movies followed, but only until 1996. She maintained homes in New Hampshire and Arizona, and it was in Scottsdale that Maureen died on June 23, 1998, of a heart attack.

After moving to California, she worked as a maid and cook for Stella Stevens and as a key-punch operator for IBM before turning to go-go dancing to make ends meet. Her stage name Kitten came from her shyness.At age 21, she had her first breast implant surgery in Tijuana (where it was legal) on the advice of her agent. Kitten Natividad was introduced to Russ Meyer by fellow dancer Shari Eubank, a performer in Meyer''s 1975 film Supervixens. Meyer hired her to narrate his movie Up!, where she was shown sitting nude in a tree, quoting the poetry of Hilda Doolittle and acting as a Greek chorus to the nonsensical action. Meyer was so impressed he wanted her to star in his next feature, Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens, one of several collaborations between Meyer and film critic Roger Ebert. He paid for a second breast enhancement and voice lessons to eliminate her accent. She left her husband for Meyer during the filming, and they lived together as a couple for most of the next 15 years. After this, Natividad moved into pornographic modeling, mainly doing glamour or girl-girl shoots with the likes of Candy Samples, Uschi Digard, and Patty Plenty. The appearances increased her dancing income many times over. She incorporated a giant champagne glass into her act (similar to Lili St. Cyr), accompanied by the Bobby Darin hit "Splish Splash."

She famously appeared as a stripper at the bachelor party held by Sean Penn to celebrate his 1985 marriage to Madonna.

Sheldon Leonard Bershad (February 22, 1907 – January 11, 1997) was an American film and television actor, producer, director, and writer.  Sheldon Leonard Bershad was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of middle class Jewish parents Anna Levit and Frank Bershad. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1929.

As an actor, Leonard specialized in playing supporting characters, especially gangsters or "heavies", in films such as It''s a Wonderful Life (1946; as bartender Nick), To Have and Have Not (1944), Guys and Dolls (1955), and Open Secret (1948). His trademark was his especially thick New York accent, usually delivered from the side of his mouth. In Decoy (1946), Leonard uses his "heavy" persona to create the hard-boiled police detective Joe Portugal.

On radio from 1945 to 1955, Leonard played an eccentric racetrack tout on The Jack Benny Program and later in the TV series of the same name. His role was to salute Benny out of the blue in railroad stations, on street corners, or in department stores ("Hey Bud. C''mere a minute."), ask Benny what he was about to do, and then proceed to try to argue him out of his course of action by resorting to inane and irrelevant racing logic. As "The Tout," he never gave out information on horse racing, unless Jack demanded it. One excuse the tout gave was, "Who knows about horses?"

Leonard was part of the cast of voice actors on the Damon Runyon Theatre radio show (1948-1949). He was part of the ensemble cast of the Martin and Lewis radio show. He also appeared frequently on The Adventures of the Saint, often playing gangsters and heavies, but also sometimes in more positive roles. Leonard was also a regular on the radio comedy series The Adventures of Maisie in the 1940s. During the 1950s, Leonard provided the voice of lazy fat cat Dodsworth in two Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoons directed by Robert McKimson.  In the adventure movie The Iroquois Trail (1950), Leonard played against type in the significant role of Chief Ogane, a Native American warrior, who pursues and fights the frontiersman Nat "Hawkeye" Cutler (George Montgomery) in a climactic duel to the death with knives.

Later in the 1950s and 1960s, he established a reputation as a producer of successful television series, including The Danny Thomas Show (aka Make Room For Daddy) (1953–64), The Andy Griffith Show (1960–68), Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. (1964–69), The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–66), and I Spy (1965–68). He also directed several TV series episodes, including four of the first eight episodes of the TV series Lassie (Season 1, 1954). Leonard also provided the voice of Linus the Lionhearted in a series of Post Crispy Critters cereal TV commercials in 1963-64, which led to a Linus cartoon series that aired on Saturday (and later, Sunday) mornings on CBS (1964–66) and ABC (1967–69). He also was briefly the star of his own television show Big Eddie (1975), where he played the owner of a large sports arena.

Zalman King (born Zalman King Lefkowitz; May 23, 1942 – February 3, 2012) was an American film director, writer, actor and producer. His films are known for incorporating sexuality, and are often categorized as erotica.

He was born Zalman Lefkovitz in Trenton, New Jersey, U.S. As a young man in 1963 he played a gang member on Alfred Hitchcock Presents ("Memo from Purgatory" written by Harlan Ellison) with James Caan and Walter Koenig. In 1967 he played the outlaw Muley in "Muley", an episode of the TV show Gunsmoke. His character shoots Marshall Matt Dillon as part of a plan to rob the Dodge City Bank, but as he and his gang are waiting for Dillon to recover (so they can try again to kill him), Muley falls in love with one of the girls at the Long Branch Saloon, which thwarts the plan.

From September 1970 until May 1971, King played attorney Aaron Silverman on the drama The Young Lawyers, broadcast on the ABC television network. King later contributed a unique delivery to Trip with the Teacher (1975), portraying the psychopathic Al, a narcoleptic murdering motorbiker.

King has directed several commercially successful films, including Two Moon Junction (1988), Wild Orchid (1990), and Red Shoe Diaries (1992), which became a long-running television series for Showtime network. It spawned many sequels. He is perhaps best known for his collaboration with director Adrian Lyne on the film 9½ Weeks which starred Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke. He produced (and usually directed) the television series and film ChromiumBlue.com and Showtime series Body Language. He appeared in Lee Grant''s directorial debut feature film Tell Me a Riddle.

Other work as director includes the 1995 film Delta of Venus based on the book by Anaïs Nin and starring Audie England. The film about an American girl living in Paris in 1939 is in many ways reminiscent of European art house films where erotica forms a centerpiece to a plot which is nevertheless about greater issues.

He is married to writer/producer Patricia Louisianna Knop. They have collaborated on many projects, such as writing Wild Orchid, Delta of Venus and 9½ Weeks as well as many episodes of Red Shoe Diaries. They have two daughters, Chloe King and Gillian Lefkowitz.

John Doe (born John Nommensen Duchac on February 25, 1954 in Decatur, Illinois) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, poet and bass player. Doe founded the much-praised L.A. punk band X, of which he is still an active member. His musical compositions and performances span the rock, country and folk music genres. As an actor, he has dozens of television appearances and several movies to his credit, including the role of Jeff Parker in the television series Roswell.

In addition to X, Doe performs with the country-folk-punk band The Knitters and has released records as a solo artist. In the early 1980s, he performed on two albums by The Flesh Eaters.

In the 1989 biopic Great Balls of Fire!, Doe played Jerry Lee Lewis''s cousin-turned-father-in-law J. W. Brown. Doe starred in the 1992 film Roadside Prophets and in the 1998 short Lone Greasers. Other movie acting credits include Road House, Vanishing Point, Salvador, Boogie Nights, The Specials, The Good Girl, Gypsy 83 and Pure Country. As a musician with X, he has two feature-length concert films, several music videos, and an extended performance-and-interview sequence in The Decline of Western Civilization, Penelope Spheeris''s seminal documentary about the early-1980s L.A. punk scene.

Along with co-writer Exene Cervenka, Doe composed most of the songs recorded by X. Wild Gift, an album from that band''s heyday, was named "Record of the Year" by Rolling Stone, The Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times. With Dave Alvin, he co-wrote two of the songs on the Blasters'' 1984 album Hard Line, "Just Another Sunday" and "Little Honey".

In the 1992 movie The Bodyguard (starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston), it was Doe''s version of "I Will Always Love You" that plays on the jukebox when Costner and Houston''s characters are dancing. It was released on audio cassette by Warner Bros. in September 1992, but is difficult to obtain (though bootleg copies can be downloaded from the Internet). No version is believed to have been released on CD.

"The Meanest Man in the World" by Doe was featured in Season 4 of the television series Friday Night Lights and included on the second soundtrack album.

John Doe released an album with Canadian indie rock band The Sadies called Country Club on April 14, 2009. The album features covers of country classics along with original songs.

Edward Davis Wood, Jr. (October 10, 1924 – December 10, 1978), better known as Ed Wood, was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author, and editor, who often performed many of these functions simultaneously. In the 1950s, Wood made a number of cheap genre films, now enjoyed for their technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, large amounts of ill-fitting stock footage, idiosyncratic dialogue, eccentric casts and outlandish plot elements, although his flair for showmanship gave his projects at least a modicum of critical success.

Wood''s popularity waned soon after his biggest "name" star, Béla Lugosi, died. He was able to salvage a saleable feature from Lugosi''s last moments on film, but his career declined thereafter. Toward the end of his life, Wood made pornographic movies and wrote pulp crime, horror, and sex novels. His infamy began two years after his death, when he was awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time.[1] The lack of filmmaking ability in his work has earned Wood and his films a considerable cult following.

Following the publication of Rudolph Grey''s biography Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr. (1992), Wood''s life and work have undergone a public rehabilitation of sorts, with new light shed on his evident zeal and honest love of movies and movie production. Tim Burton''s biopic of the director''s life, Ed Wood, earned two Academy Awards.

He was born in Anchorage, Alaska, on an Army base. He grew up and attended schools in Fort Collins, Colorado.

Paragon is probably best known for his work on children''s show Pee-wee''s Playhouse where he played Jambi the Genie and voiced Pterri the Pterodactyl. In addition to writing many of the regular season episodes of Playhouse, Paragon also co-wrote (with Paul Reubens) the acclaimed Pee-wee''s Playhouse Christmas Special in 1988, for which they were nominated an Emmy Award for Best Writing in a Children''s Special.

Some of Paragon''s other memorable roles include Cedric, one half of the gay couple Bob and Cedric on the television series Seinfeld; the title character in the children''s movie The Frog Prince; the sex shop salesman in the cult favorite Eating Raoul; and the owner of a Strip-o-gram business in the 1986 film Echo Park.

Paragon got his start in the Los Angeles-based improvisation group The Groundlings alongside Reubens and Phil Hartman. He also collaborated with fellow Groundling Cassandra Peterson on numerous Elvira projects, including the recurring role of The Breather, an annoying caller, for her first television series on KHJ-TV-Los Angeles.

In recent years, Paragon has worked with Walt Disney Imagineering on ways to incorporate improvisational performance into attractions at Disney parks. In this capacity, he performed as the keeper of Lucky the Dinosaur during the test runs of the animatronic figure.

Paragon returned to his performance as Jambi the Genie in the Broadway outing of the new Pee-wee Herman stage show that began performances 26 October 2010 at the Stephen Sondheim Theater.

The epitome of the word "statuesque," brunette, big blue-eyed, and 6'' tall Lynda Carter was once considered one of the most beautiful women in the western world. Born and raised in Phoenix, AZ, Carter''s height caused considerable awkwardness in high school. Friends encouraged her to become a performer; she began studying voice and by the time she graduated, she was named her school''s most talented student. She briefly attended Arizona State University, but dropped out to become a professional singer and tour the country with several rock groups. By 1972, Carter had returned home and entered a local beauty pageant. She won and went on to win the title of Miss World-USA. After that, Carter studied acting in New York. She started her career in television making guest appearances on such shows as Starsky and Hutch, but Carter did not become famous until winning the title role of Wonder Woman in 1975. The Wonder Woman shows originally started out as specials on the ABC network, but by 1976 had been turned into a series. The network canceled the show after one season and it was picked up by CBS and aired there for a few years. When the series ended, she had a somewhat successful career as a Las Vegas entertainer. She also continues to occasionally appear in television movies and as a series guest star. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi', 'Phoenix, Arizona, USA', 1, '/3Ic76fGqeUK93s7hLDqvtfO2kof.jpg'),

She decided to stay and found employment as a manager at a Musicland record store in Redlands. She had lived in a trailer in one of the worst parts of the city for almost a year when she answered an ad for figure models. This led to employment the same day and a layout in Penthouse magazine.

Work in the adult-film industry soon followed. She worked in the industry from December 1983 through February 1986, making a total of 69 films (plus countless re-issues and compilations). She retired, partially because the work was no longer fun and she had very little time off. That same year, she was approached by the FBI to testify on behalf of Traci Lords, who had just been exposed as having been underage during her years in the adult-film industry. She refused and was eventually arrested for tax evasion.

Following her years in adult movies, she appeared in many "legit" films throughout the late 1980s and 1990s-- most notably the "Vice Academy" films. She also starred in Metallica''s music video "Turn the Page." She has a son, whom she gave birth to on March 24, 1996.

His grandfather, Eugenio Bava (1886-1966), was a cameraman and optics effects artist during the early days of Italian silent cinema. His father, Mario Bava (1914-1980), was a legendary cinematographer, special effects designer and director. Lamberto entered the cinema as his father''s personal assistant, starting with Planet of the Vampires (1965). Bit by bit he gained experience from his father, who made him the assistant director for most of the rest of his films. He even co-wrote the screenplay for Shock (1977) ("Shock"), Mario''s last theatrical film where. In poor health during the shoot, Mario often feigned illness so Lamberto could direct a few scenes, uncredited, to gain further experience.

Both Lamberto and Mario directed the made-for-TV drama I giochi del diavolo: La Venere d''Ille (1979). Both worked on the Dario Argento horror flick Inferno (1980), for which Mario designed some of the color set pieces, including the underwater ballroom, and created all the visual special effects, while Lamberto worked as Argento''s assistant director. Late in 1979 Lamberto made his solo directorial debut with Macabre (1980), a tense drama-horror flick loosely based on a 1977 incident in New Orleans about a woman who keeps her lover''s severed head in her freezer. According to Lamberto, the project started by chance when producer Pupi Avati approached him to direct as well as write the screenplay, which took just six weeks to write and direct. "Macabro" was released in Italy in February 1980 to mixed reviews, but won him recognition by his father Mario. Just two months later Mario Bava died, and an era in Italian film making came to a close.

''Macabro" was not the box-office hit and, as a result, Lamberto went back to assistant directing. He worked with Dario Argento again in 1982 with Tenebrae (1982). In 1983 Lamberto was offered to direct another film, titled A Blade in the Dark (1983), which was a violent mystery thriller shot in only three weeks on a tight budget and filmed almost entirely in a producer friend''s house. Next he directed the action-flick Blastfighter (1984), which was filmed in the state of Georgia, and immediately afterwards directed the Jaws (1975)-like thriller Devil Fish (1984), which was shot in Florida. On both films Lamberto was purely a director for hire and had nothing to do with the script or production end. He used the pseudonym of "John Old Jr." for this film, which was a tribute to his father Mario, who often used the pseudonym "John M. Old".

He enjoyed his best commercial success to date with Demons (1985) ("Demons"), produced by Dario Argento, co-written by Dardano Sacchetti and filmed in West Berlin, Germany. This films international success allowed him to co-write, produce and direct a sequel, Demons 2 (1986). Lamberto returned to "giallo" thrillers with Delirium (1987).

In the late 1980s the Italian cinema turned moribund. Lamberto, like most of his colleagues, turned to making films for Italian television. He also directed a remake of his father''s Black Sunday (1960), which was titled La maschera del demonio (1990).

Nowadays Lamberto Bava continues to divide his time between TV work and a few movies, acknowledging his inspiration from his late father, Mario.', 'Roma, Lazio, Italia', 2, '/4urZfizR36I5FHbkvk8l4VnOEMA.jpg'),

A  brother of star Dana Andrews,  he was born William Forrest Andrews, the youngest of thirteen children.  His father was a Baptist minister in Huntsville, Texas. In 1942, Steve  enlisted in the U.S. Army, rose to the rank of sergeant and saw action  at the Battle of the Bulge. Following his demobilisation, he visited his  brother in Hollywood and came to the conclusion that acting wasn''t a  bad way to make a living (having already done some work as a movie  extra). He went on to study in college at UCLA, eventually graduating in  1950 with a B.A. Honours Degree in theatre arts. He then served a brief  apprenticeship as a carpenter, prop boy and set builder at San Diego''s  La Jolla Playhouse, where he was discovered by resident actor Gregory Peck  and given a small part as a bellboy in the cast of the summer stock  production of "Goddbye Again". A subsequent screen test led to a  contract with MGM and resulting employment as second leads, brothers of  the titular star, toughs and outlaws. His first proper recognition was  being awarded ''New Star of the Year'' by Golden Globe for his role in So Big (1953), a drama based on a Pulitzer prize-winning novel by Edna Ferber.

From  the mid-1950''s, the rangy, 6-foot-3 actor became much in-demand on TV,  beginning with classic early anthology and western series, interspersed  with occasional appearances on the big screen (notably, in The Longest Day (1962) and as Joan Crawford''s lover/attorney Greg Savitt in Mommie Dearest (1981)). In addition to numerous guest roles, he was regularly featured in series like Gunsmoke (1955), Dallas (1978) (as Wes Parmalee, who believes himself to be lost Ewing patriarch Jock) and Murder, She Wrote  (1984). Already from the mid-60''s, he decided to pick his assignments  more carefully. In order to shed his image as the perpetual bad guy, he  had relocated his family to England to star as  antique-dealer-cum-undercover intelligence agent John Mannering in BBC''s  The Baron  (1966). He followed this by another starring role as the stoic, tough  Lieutenant Dan ''Hondo'' Harrelson in the short-lived ABC police drama  series S.W.A.T. (1975), possibly his best-remembered role. Steve later lampooned his screen personae in the satirical Amazon Women on the Moon (1987).

Dame Edith Mary Evans, DBE (8 February 1888 – 14 October 1976) was a British actress. She was known for her work on the British stage. She also appeared in a number of films, for which she received three Academy Award nominations, plus a BAFTA and a Golden Globe award.

Evans was particularly effective at portraying haughty aristocratic ladies, as in two of her most famous roles: Lady Bracknell in The Importance of Being Earnest (both on stage and in the 1952 film), and Miss Western in the 1963 film of Tom Jones. By contrast, she played a poverty-stricken old woman in one of her most acclaimed film roles, in The Whisperers (1967).

Cilento''s parents, Sir Raphael Cilento  and Lady (Phyllis) Cilento,  were both distinguished medical practitioners.  At a young age she decided to follow a career as an actress, and after a period living with her father in New York, won a scholarship to RADA and moved to England in the early 1950s.  She soon secured roles in British films and steadily worked until the end of the decade.

In 1956, Cilento was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Dramatic) for Helen of Troy in Jean Giraudoux'' Tiger at the Gates.

Cilento was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Tom Jones in 1963  and appeared in The Third Secret the following year, but she allowed her film career to decline following her marriage to actor Sean Connery, the second of her three husbands, to whom she was married from 1962 to 1973. They are the parents of actor Jason Connery. In Connery''s James Bond film You Only Live Twice, she doubled for her husband''s co-star Mie Hama in a diving scene because Hama was indisposed.  Cilento starred with Charlton Heston in the 1965 classic "The agony and the ecstacy" and with Paul Newman in the 1967 western film Hombre.

In 1985, Cilento married Anthony Shaffer, a playwright, who wrote the script of The Wicker Man; she met him when she appeared in the film in 1973, and joined her when she returned to Queensland in 1975. During the 1970s, she studied Sufism under the British spiritual teacher John G. Bennett.  Cilento continued working as an actress, both in films and in television and, in the 1980s, settled in Mossman, north of Cairns, where she built her own outdoor theatre, named "Karnak", in the rainforest. The venture allows her to participate in experimental drama.

In 2006, Cilento released her autobiography, My Nine Lives.

He returned to editing before making another comeback in 1976 with two low-budget Nazi exploitation films, Women''s Camp 119 (1977) (aka "Women''s Camp 119") and Casa privata per le SS (1977) (aka "SS Girls"). Mattei followed these taboo-breaking films with excursions into porno films and mondo "shockumentaries", all directed under his many pseudonyms, concentrating on "shock value" with films such as Mondo erotico (1973), "Libiodomania" and "Libidomania 2". Always on the lookout for new exploitation avenues, Mattei followed with "nunsploitation", with the softcore sex film La vera storia della monaca di Monza (1980) and the violent sex thriller The Other Hell (1981). Both films involved a partnership with writer/director Claudio Fragasso, who helped him write and direct the back-to-back productions. Using yet another alias, "Vincent Dawn", Mattei directed Hell of the Living Dead (1980) (aka "Hell of the Living Dead"), a low-budged zombie picture inspired by other zombie cannibal movies such as Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Lucio Fulci''s Zombi 2 (1979). "Virus" was filmed in Spain and used jungle footage from New Guinea and a patch soundtrack from Goblins "Dawn of the Dead" soundtrack, which was a minor hit in Italy and abroad. After directing two women''s prison films starring Laura Gemser, Mattei moved to directing sword-and-sorcery flicks, starting with I sette magnifici gladiatori (1983). Both Mattei and Fragasso collaborated on the sci-fi/horror flick Rats - Notte di terrore (1984), inspired by the futuristic movies of the early 1980s. Mattei considers this his best work, despite his still having to work with a very low budget. He worked relentlessly through the 1980s, directing a pair of "spaghetti westerns", some action flicks and about half of Zombi 3 (1988) after Lucio Fulci was taken off the production, though Mattei was not credited with it. In the early 1990s Mattei directed a series of erotic thrillers and a made-for-TV movie, Cruel Jaws (1995) (TV), which was inspired by Steven Spielberg''s Jaws (1975). Mattei continued making films, with more than 50 to his credit by the 200s. In early 2007 his health becan to decline rapidly after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Despite his doctor''s warnings, he went through with a surgical operation to have the tumor removed in May of that year.

Robert Leon (Bob) Phillips (born June 23, 1951) is an American television journalist best known for his long-running program Texas Country Reporter. In 2005 Phillips was inducted into the Silver Circle of the Lone Star Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the association that gives the Emmy Awards; the honor is extended to professionals who have spent at least 25 years of their career in television in Texas and have made significant contributions to their industry and their communities.  Phillips was born in Dallas, Texas, where he graduated in 1969 from Bryan Adams High School. He grew up around the hotel industry with a mother whose specialty was helping hotels to establish their housekeeping staff; in a 2006 interview, Phillips stated that his first paying job was assisting the executive chef at the Dallas Hilton Hotel, adding, "I found out real fast that washing dishes was not what I wanted to do." He attended Southern Methodist University, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1973 and a Master of Liberal Arts degree in 1977.

An admirer of CBS broadcast journalist Charles Kuralt, Phillips chose the same field. He began working at local CBS affiliate KDFW as a gofer his first year in college, started learning to use a TV camera, and within three months was reassigned as a photographer. He got his break in March 1970 when he was sent to shoot film about a possible drowning and no reporter was available to interview the youths involved, who had in fact survived; after preparing the equipment, Phillips stepped in front to report the story while the camera ran itself, a procedure that would come to be his regular mode of operations.  Initially focusing on political and sports coverage, the novice reporter pursued his goal of filming feature stories for inclusion on local broadcasts. Instead, the management decided to package his features in a separate half-hour weekend program, and 4 Country Reporter debuted in 1972.  In 1986 he left Channel 4, renamed the show Texas Country Reporter, and began producing and syndicating it through his own company, Phillips Productions; the show aired in all 22 broadcast markets in Texas including rival station WFAA, which renamed the show 8 Country Reporter, and eventually was added to stations in neighboring Louisiana. When RFD-TV launched in December 2000, Texas Country Reporter was one of its featured programs, introducing the show to audiences around the nation. Phillips was closely involved with the channel''s development from the time he was approached about adding his show to the lineup, and through his company assisted with management of the fledging channel.  As an extension of his 35 years of broadcast journalism, Phillips has authored several books — mostly on Texas travel and cuisine — and serves periodically as a host at Escondida, the Texas Country Reporter Hacienda and Spa, in Central Texas'' Hill Country region.He teaches at Amberton University. In 2007, Bob married KFDM-TV anchor Kelli Adkins. They currently reside in Beaumont, and also have a home in Dallas and a ranch in Medina, Texas.

Obregón has appeared in films from countries including Spain, France, United States and Italy but she is best known for her high-profile personal life and her career as a television actress most notably for her performances in the Spanish television series A las once en casa and Ana y los siete.

She is best known to American audiences for her role as Bo Derek''s sidekick in 1984''s Bolero. She also appeared in an episode of Who''s the Boss, playing Ana, Tony Miceli''s Italian cousin. She also Co-starred in the 1983 3-D action adventure film Treasure of the four crowns with Tony Anthony.

A staple of the Spanish prensa rosa or gossip press, Obregón is also famous in Spain and Britain for a long relationship with Croatia striker Davor Šuker as well as a supposed liaison with the Real Madrid and England international football player David Beckham. This led to a spat with Beckham''s wife Victoria who famously referred to the 50-year old as a "geriatric Barbie". Obregón later denied any sexual misconduct on her part, but sued instead.

Obregón found herself in the midst of controversy in 2007 following information disclosed by Interviú, and subsequently published by the major newspapers in Spain: according to said media, an ostensibly distraught Obregón allegedly called her bodyguard Eloy Sánchez Barba in order to ask him to hire third parties to beat up or physically assault journalist Jaime Cantinzano, in reprisal for what she deemed an unacceptable public exposal of her teenage son. According to these sources of information, she said: "... but I don''t want this done by just anyone, I want you to have los Miami doing this", in reference to a well-known criminal group established mainly in Madrid.Unbeknownst to her and Sánchez Barba, the latter''s telephone line had been tapped by the Spanish police in connection to their investigation of a hit job presumably coordinated by Sánchez Barba months before.

She began to pester her mother about acting lessons when she was three. Her mother was very reluctant to encourage this interest.

Still Genna persevered and finally her mother allowed her to take a small course in acting from the local theatre - Vancouver Youth Theatre. After completing the course Genna asked if she could please audition for the youth theatre''s acting tour. Her mother refused, explaining that as Genna had no experience; the chances were not high that she would make the selection. Later that evening the director for the tour called their home demanding to know why Genevieve Buechner had not come to the audition. A special audition was set up for her the next day, and Genna was selected as the youngest member of the cast. During the tour performances, Genna was scouted by Robert Carrier and signed to Carrier Talent Management in Vancouver Canada.

A week later Genevieve was sent to audition for the lead in a Toronto Independent Film called St. Monica. Both Mother and child were utterly unprepared for the audition, and Genna showed up in dirty clothes, with unbrushed hair. Casting Director Carol Tarlington took pity on the hapless two, explained some of the rules, tidied her up and prepared her for the camera. Genevieve Buechner got the lead role at the age of ten years - the first film audition that she had ever been to and was flown to Toronto within three days. The film went on to be a festival success playing across North America and being selected for the Berlin Film Festival, the Atlantic Film Festival, the Toronto Film Festival and the Vancouver Film Festival. She was nominated for a Canadian Leo Award for Best Lead performance by a female in 2003 for that role.

Since then she has been cast in Feature Films, lead roles in M.O.W. and has had recurring roles in Television series including the Battlestar spin- off "Caprica" as Tamara Adams.

She has been a huge supporter of independent films.

Gedrick began his career as an extra in films such as Bad Boys (1983) and Risky Business (1983). After roles in The Heavenly Kid (1985), Iron Eagle (1986), Promised Land (1987) with director Michael Hoffman, Iron Eagle II (1988 in an uncredited role for the first few minutes of the movie), Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Backdraft (1991), and Crossing the Bridge (1992), Gedrick appeared in television series such as Class of ''96 (1993) and Sweet Justice (1994). In 1994, Gedrick starred in the film The Force with Yasmine Bleeth and Kim Delaney. Gedrick''s big break was in Steven Bochco''s innovative 1995 series Murder One. The series followed the trial of Gedrick''s character, bad-boy actor Neil Avedon, alleged to have murdered a 15-year-old girl. The series, which also starred talent such as Daniel Benzali, Patricia Clarkson, Mary McCormack, Dylan Baker and Stanley Tucci was a runaway success. Due to this, a second season was commissioned. Due to network concerns, the new season featured several small cases rather than one big one. Anthony LaPaglia stepped in to replace the cast such as Benzali, Tucci and Gedrick, who had left, and the series was canceled midway through its second season. Gedrick''s next major project was the three-hour TV movie The Third Twin, a 1997 thriller based on the best-selling 1996 novel by British writer Ken Follett. Gedrick plays a university employee accused of rape, whose friend later discovers he has a twin--and actually several more twins cloned by an evil millionaire university donor and biomedical technology CEO (played to the hilt by Larry Hagman, a.k.a. Dallas''s J. R. Ewing). Gedrick next took roles in television series such as EZ Streets (1996), Falcone (2000) and The Beast (2001). None of which were major successes. In 1999, he guest starred on Ally McBeal as the "hot car wash guy". Also appearing in Mario Puzo''s 1997 mini-series, The Last Don and in its sequel, The Last Don II. Gedrick returned to television screens as Tom Turcotte in 2002''s Boomtown. The series, which also starred Donnie Wahlberg and Neal McDonough was a moderate success, but ratings plummeted - particularly after the second season suffered a format change, and Boomtown was cancelled. In 2003, Gedrick played Andrew Luster, the infamous rapist in a Lifetime movie based on his trial, A Date with Darkness. Gedrick is part of the cast of the 2006 NBC television series Windfall also starring Luke Perry and Gedrick''s former Boomtown alumni, Lana Parrilla. In 2007 Gedrick again starred alongside Donnie Wahlberg in the A&E original movie Kings of South Beach. He is also the new love interest at Scavo''s Pizzeria in Desperate Housewives Season 3 and 4 on ABC.

He moved into music hall, where he enjoyed modest success and renamed himself Freddie Frinton.

During the Second World War he made a moderate breakthrough as a comedian. In 1945, Frinton first performed the sketch Dinner for One in Blackpool. As he had to pay a royalty every time he performed the sketch, he bought the rights to Dinner for One in the 1950s, which turned out to be a very prescient decision.

At the age of 55, Frinton became a belated success as the plumber husband in the popular television sitcom Meet the Wife, which ran for 40 episodes (the wife was played by Thora Hird). The series is mentioned in the Beatles song "Good Morning Good Morning" with the line "It''s time for tea and Meet the Wife".

Anne Fontaine (born in Luxembourg, 1959) is a filmmaker and screenwriter who used to be an actor. She lives and works in France.

Born Fontaine Sibertin-Blanc, sister of actor Jean-Chrétien Sibertin-Blanc, she went as a young child to live in Lisbon, where her father, Antoine Sibertin-Blanc, is a music professor and cathedral organist. In adolescence she moved to Paris and trained in dance with Joseph Russillo while continuing her academic education, including philosophy. Her husband is Philippe Carcassonne, the film producer, and they have an adopted son who was born in Vietnam.

While still dancing, she was picked by Robert Hossein to play Esmeralda in a 1980 theatrical production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and around this time started to use the name Anne Fontaine. She continued with acting and became known for her roles in comedies like Si ma gueule vous plaît... (1981) and P.R.O.F.S.(1985). An opportunity to be assistant director came with a 1986 stage version of Céline''s Voyage au bout de la nuit (Journey to the End of the Night) at the Renaud-Barrault theatre.

Fontaine''s first project as solo director, Les histoires d''amour finissent mal... en général (Love Affairs Usually End Badly), won the 1993 Prix Jean Vigo (prize). In 1995, she worked with her brother on the comic Augustin. Two years later, she wrote and directed the successful Nettoyage à Sec (Dry Cleaning). This won the Best Screenplay award at the Venice Film Festival 1997 and is generally considered a milestone on Fontaine''s way to becoming "an important figure in contemporary French cinema".

In 1999 the character Augustin (Jean-Chrétien Sibertin-Blanc) re-appeared in Fontaine''s film Augustin, Roi Du Kung-Fu (Augustin, King of Kung-Fu). Comment j''ai tué mon père (How I Killed My Father) was released in 2001, and Nathalie... followed in 2003. The 2005 film, Entre Ses Mains (In His Hands) has been widely described as a thriller: an "intimate thriller" according to Fontaine herself. A third Augustin film, Nouvelle chance (also known as Oh La La) was released in 2006. Then came La fille de Monaco (The Girl From Monaco) in 2008 and Coco avant Chanel (Coco Before Chanel), her biopic of Coco Chanel, in 2009.

Fontaine''s work is not easily categorised, though the phrase "psychological drama" is often used. She told a UK newspaper, "I try to work on my characters'' blind side, in a kind of Freudian way: to ask, ''What are the things about themselves that they''re unaware of?'' I''m fascinated by the irony of fate, when something goes into a skid. All my stories have an element of cruelty in them."

Born of Norwegian heritage (the family name, Aurness (formerly  had been Aursness) in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Rolf and Ruth  Duesler Aurness. His father was a traveling salesman of medical supplies  and his mother later became a newspaper columnist. James attended West  High School in Minneapolis. Although he appeared in school plays, he had  no interest in performing, and dreamed instead of going to sea. After  high school, he attended one semester at Beloit College before receiving  his draft notice in 1943. He entered the army and trained at Camp  Wheeler, Georgia, before shipping out for North Africa. After landing at  Casablanca, Arness joined the 3rd Infantry Division in time for the  invasion of Anzio. Ten days after the invasion, Arness was severely  wounded in the leg and foot by German machine-gun fire. His wounds,  which plagued him the rest of his life, resulted in his medical  discharge from the army. While recuperating in a Clinton, Iowa hospital,  he was visited by his younger brother Peter (later to gain fame as  actor Peter Graves),  who suggested he take a radio course at the University of Minnesota.  James did so, and a teacher recommended him for a job as an announcer at  a Minneapolis radio station. Though seemingly headed for success in  radio, he followed a boyhood friend''s suggestion and went with the  friend to Hollywood in hopes of getting work as film extras. He studied  at the Bliss-Hayden Theatre School under actor Harry Hayden, and while appearing in a play there was spotted by agent Leon Lance. Lance got the actor a role as Loretta Young''s brother in The Farmer''s Daughter (1947). The director of that film, H.C. Potter,  recommended that he drop the "u" from his last name and soon thereafter  the actor was officially known as James Arness. Little work followed  this break,  He appeared in a production of  "Candida", and married his leading  lady, Virginia Chapman.  He began to get small roles with frequency, often, due to his size,  villainous characters. Most notable among these was that of the space  alien in The Thing from Another World (1951). While playing a Greek warrior in a play, Arness was spotted by agent Charles K. Feldman, who represented John Wayne.  Feldman introduced Arness to Wayne, who put the self-described 6'' 6"  actor under personal contract. Arness played several roles over the next  few years for and with Wayne, whom he considered a mentor. In 1955,  Wayne recommended Arness for the lead role of Matt Dillon in the TV  series Gunsmoke  (1955). (Contrary to urban legend, Wayne himself was never offered the  role.) Arness at first declined, thinking a TV series could derail his  growing film career, but Wayne argued for the show, and Arness accepted.

Walter Hampden is the artist name of Walter Hampden Dougherty (June 30, 1879 in Brooklyn – June 11, 1955 in Los Angeles) was a U.S. actor and theatre manager. He was the younger brother of the American painter Paul Dougherty (1877-1947).

He went to England for apprenticeship for six years. Later, he played Hamlet, Henry V and Cyrano de Bergerac on Broadway. In 1925, he became manager of the Colonial Theatre on Broadway. He became noted for his Shakespearean roles as well as for Cyrano, which he played in several productions between 1923 and 1936. Hampden''s last stage role was as Danforth in the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller''s The Crucible.

Hampden appeared in a few silent films, but did not really begin his film career in earnest until 1939, when he played the good Archbishop of Paris[1] (Frollo''s brother) in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, starring Charles Laughton as Quasimodo. This was Hampden''s first sound film ; he was sixty at the time he made it. Several other roles followed—Jarvis Langdon in the 1944 film The Adventures of Mark Twain among them, but all were supporting character roles, not the lead roles that Hampden played onstage. He had a small, but notable role as the long-winded dinner speaker in the first scene of All About Eve (1950), and played the father of Humphrey Bogart and William Holden in Billy Wilder''s 1954 comedy Sabrina. These last two films are arguably the ones that Hampden is most well known to modern audiences for. He also played long-bearded patriarchs in biblical epics like The Silver Chalice (1954) and The Prodigal (1955). (In The Silver Chalice, he was Joseph of Arimathea.)

Hampden reprised his legendary portrayal of Hercule Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac in the first episode of the radio program Great Scenes from Great Plays, which Hampden hosted from 1948-1949. In addition to his radio roles (The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall), Hampden also appeared in several dramas during the early days of television. He made his TV debut in 1949, playing Macbeth for the last time at the age of 69.

His last role was the non-singing one of King Louis XI of France, considered by some to be one of his best performances, in the otherwise unremarkable 1956 Technicolor remake of Rudolf Friml''s 1925 operetta The Vagabond King. It was released posthumously, more than a year after Hampden''s death.

For 27 years, Walter Hampden was president of the Players'' Club. The club''s library is named for him.

Walker was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, and in her teens became half of the husband and wife vaudeville team "Mack and Walker", with her husband Wilbur Mack. By 1929 she had launched a film acting career, her first film role being in Tanned Legs alongside Sally Blane, Dorothy Revier, June Clyde, and Arthur Lake. She appeared in three films in 1929, and easily transitioned to "talking films", appearing in another four films in 1930, possibly making the smooth transition because she was never an established silent film actress.

In 1931 her film career took off, with her appearing in ten films that year, five of which were uncredited. Her marriage ended not long after her film career was on the rise, and from 1932-33 she appeared in fifteen films, only five of which were uncredited. In 1935, her career improved, and between that year and 1938 she had 23 film appearances. Her biggest film appearance during that period was in Young Dr. Kildare alongside Lionel Barrymore and Lew Ayres. Throughout the 1930s her career was strong, and, despite her never being a premier "star", she repeatedly had solid acting roles. She finished that decade strong in 1939 with nine film roles, only three of which were uncredited.

The 1940s mirrored her success of the previous decade in many ways, with her appearing in 37 films from 1940 to 1947. Now later in her career, and over 60 years of age, she slowed her career for a time, not having another role until 1950 when she appeared in Nancy Goes to Rio alongside Ann Sothern and Carmen Miranda. She appeared in another two films in 1952, then had her last film acting role in 1954, in the film Sabrina alongside Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn.', 'Chicago, Illinois, USA', 1, '/kl8WuqmPAuwqaOne9fod7kkwcTQ.jpg'),

Francis Xavier Bushman (January 10, 1883 – August 23, 1966) was an American actor, film director, and screenwriter. His matinee idol career started in 1911 in the silent film His Friend''s Wife, but it did not survive the silent screen era. Bushman, like many of his contemporaries, broke into the film business via the stage. He was performing at Broncho Billy Anderson''s Essanay Studios in Chicago, Illinois, where he was first noticed for his muscular, sculpted frame. He appeared in nearly 200 feature film roles—more than 175 films before 1920, and 17 in his screen debut year of 1911 alone. He also worked for the Vitagraph studio before signing with Metro in 1915.

He is best known for playing the fourteen-year-old Tadzio in Luchino Visconti''s 1971 film adaptation of the Thomas Mann novella Death in Venice.

Andrésen had only appeared in one film, En kärlekshistoria (1970) at the time he was cast in Death in Venice, which gained him international recognition. While the film performed relatively poorly at the box office, Andrésen was noted for his performance as Tadzio, the beautiful young Polish boy with whom the film''s older protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach becomes obsessed. Film historian Lawrence J. Quirk commented in his study The Great Romantic Films (1974) that some shots of Andrésen "could be extracted from the frame and hung on the walls of the Louvre or the Vatican".

Rumors circulated in America at the time of the film''s release as to whether or not Andrésen was homosexual (as the role demanded that he appear to exchange romantic glances with the protagonist, and on another occasion, be kissed and caressed by another teenage boy). Andrésen emphatically denied these, and later recounted his discomfort at being forced by director Luchino Visconti during filming to visit a gay bar, where he attracted the attention of a number of older men.  Eager to dispel the rumors regarding his sexuality and to shed his "pretty boy" image, Andrésen thereafter avoided homosexual roles and parts which he felt would play off of his good looks, and was angry when feminist writer Germaine Greer used a photograph of him on the cover of her book The Beautiful Boy (2003) without first obtaining his personal permission. Although Greer did consult photographer David Bailey (who owned the copyright for the image) before publishing the book, Andrésen maintained that it is common practice when a party uses an image of a person which has been copyrighted by a different individual to inform the individual and that he would not have given his consent for Greer to use his picture if she had informed him of her plans.

Andrésen has also appeared in several other films.These include Pelikaanimies (2004),  Kojan (1992) and Smugglarkungen (1985).

Lawrence "Larry" Peerce (born April 19, 1930) is an American film and TV director whose work includes the theatrical feature Goodbye, Columbus, the early rock and roll concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, One Potato, Two Potato (1964), The Other Side of the Mountain (1975), and Oscar nominee Two-Minute Warning (1976).

The son of operatic tenor Jan Peerce and talent agent Alice (Kalmanowitz) Peerce, Larry Peerce was born in The Bronx, New York City, New York. He attended the University of North Carolina. He made his directing debut with One Potato, Two Potato, released in 1964 by the distributor Cinema V. The groundbreaking drama about an interracial marriage between a white divorcee (played by Barbara Barrie, who won the Best Actress award at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival for the role) and an African-American office worker (Bernie Hamilton) was the first U.S. movie to portray such an interracial relationship.

Peerce went on to direct several episodes of the Western television series Branded and the campy superhero series Batman, among other shows, before directing the early rock and roll concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, released in 1966 by American International Pictures and featuring such performers as The Byrds, Ray Charles, Bo Diddley, Donovan, The Lovin'' Spoonful, The Ronettes and The Ike & Tina Turner Revue.

Following more TV, Peerce returned to film in 1967 with The Mystery of the Chinese Junk and The Incident, the latter of which starred Martin Sheen and Tony Musante. He followed this with the acclaimed Goodbye, Columbus, an adaptation of the Philip Roth novel. The movie earned Peerce a DGA Award nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures, and screenwriter Arnold Schulman an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.

Peerce''s subsequent theatrical features included The Sporting Club, A Separate Peace, Ash Wednesday, and The Other Side of the Mountain.

Parnell is currently one of the lead voices on the FX animated comedy Archer. In 2010, Parnell starred alongside his former SNL castmate Horatio Sanz in the Comedy Central series Big Lake.

After performing as a company player with The Groundlings for a number of years, Parnell was hired to join the cast of Saturday Night Live as a featured player on September 26, 1998, and was promoted to repertory player the following season. In the summer of 2001, budget cuts and hiring four new cast members required Lorne Michaels to dismiss two cast members; he chose to lay off Parnell and Jerry Minor over Horatio Sanz, Rachel Dratch, and Maya Rudolph.

While on SNL, Parnell appeared in numerous sketches, and commercial parodies, and performed memorable impressions of various celebrities. One of his most popular sketches is Lazy Sunday, a rap video he shot with Andy Samberg about buying cupcakes and going to see The Chronicles of Narnia. He has also performed raps about hosts Jennifer Garner, Britney Spears, Kirsten Dunst and Ashton Kutcher.

In the summer of 2006, Lorne Michaels announced that four cast members would be fired due to budget cuts, but he did not say who. On September 22, 2006 it was announced that three cast members had been fired: Parnell, Horatio Sanz, and Finesse Mitchell. This effectively made him the only SNL performer to have been fired twice by Lorne Michaels, though Parnell did say in a 2008 interview with The Sound of Young America podcast that he was okay with being let go this time, because he was considering leaving after that season anyway, but added that he probably would have stayed one last season if he was asked back. He had been with SNL for eight seasons; at the time only four people (Darrell Hammond, Tim Meadows, Kevin Nealon, and Al Franken) have been cast members longer. He has since made uncredited cameo appearances on the show, most recently in 2008 parodying newscasters Tom Brokaw, Jim Lehrer, and Bob Schieffer.

Parnell and his former SNL castmate Horatio Sanz recently starred together in Big Lake, a 2010 sitcom on Comedy Central from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.

He also recently appeared as Dr. Drummer/Santa in the SyFy Holiday Special episode from the television show Eureka, which aired on December 7, 2010 (Season 4 Episode 10).', 'Memphis, Tennessee, USA', 1, '/dLdXHfbJ7TMe3qbtNzPpSLuaMos.jpg'),

However, the environment he was born into and the circumstances naturally led him to be a thespian.

The son of future silent era swashbuckling idol Douglas Fairbanks (born Douglas Elton Thomas Ullman) and Beth Sully - the daughter of a very wealthy cotton mogul - was born in 1909 and soon proved a gifted boy. To the end of his life he remained a multi-talented, hyperactive man, not content to appear in the 100 films mentioned above. Handsome, distinguished and extremely bright, he excelled at sports (much like his father), notably during his stay at the Military Academy in 1919 (his role in Claude Autant-Lara''s "L''athlète incomplete" illustrated these abilities). He also excelled academically, and attended the Lycéee Janson de Sailly in Paris, where he had followed his divorced mother. Very early in his life he developed a taste for the arts as well and became a painter and sculptor.

Not content to limiting himself to just one field, he became involved in business, in fields as varied as mining, hotel management, owning a chain of bowling alleys and a firm that manufactured popcorn. During World War II he headed London''s Douglas Voluntary Hospital (an establishment taking care of war refugees), was President Franklin D. Roosevelt''s special envoy for the Special Mission to South America in 1940 before becoming a lieutenant in the Navy (he was promoted to the rank of captain in 1954) and taking part in the Allies'' landing in Sicily and Elba in 1943. A fervent Anglophile, Fairbanks was knighted in 1949 and often entertained Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in his London mansion, "The Boltons".

His film career began at the age of 13 when he was signed by Paramount Pictures. He debuted in Stephen Steps Out (1923), but the film flopped and his career stagnated despite a critically acclaimed role in Stella Dallas (1925). Things really picked up when he married Lucille Le Sueur, a young starlet who was soon to become better known as Joan Crawford. The young couple became the toast of the town and good parts and success followed, such as Fairbanks'' role as the hapless partner of Edward G. Robinson in Little Caesar (1931), a favorably reviewed turn as the villain in The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), or more debonair characters in slapstick comedies or adventure yarns.

The 1930s were a fruitful period for Fairbanks, his most memorable role probably being that of the British soldier in Gunga Din (1939); although it was somewhat of a "swasbuckling" role, Fairbanks made a point of never imitating his father.

After World War II, his star waned and, despite a moving part in Ghost Story (1981), he did not appear in a major movie. Now a legend himself, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. left this world with the satisfaction of having lived up to the Fairbanks name at the end of a life nobody could call "wasted".

Essentiellement tourné vers le cinéma, son début de carrière est aussi fourni que pauvre en notoriété. Outre On peut toujours rêver(1991), Vieille Canaille, (1993), Louis enfant roi(1993) ou La Cavale des fous (1993), il côtoie pourtant de grands noms du cinéma. Ainsi en 1990, il joue successivement pour Georges Lautner ( Triplex), Bertrand Blier ( Merci la vie), Thierry Lhermitte( Les Secrets professionnels du Dr Apfelglück) et Gérard Jugnot ( Une époque formidable...). En parallèle, il fait ses premiers pas sur les planches avec Silence en coulisses ! (1993) et Brèves de comptoir (1994).

Spécialisé dans les comédies légères, on le retrouve dansLa Crise (1992), puis il rejoint le casting de Tango (1993) de Patrice Leconte, avec Phillipe Noiret. Il fait aussi une incursion dans le doublage pour les films d''animation Le Roi Lion 2 (1998) et Toy Story 2 (1999).

Après une coopération fructueuse avec Jean-Michel Ribes, au cinéma comme au théâtre, il renoue avec la comédie à succès dans Le Placard (2000) de Francis Veber. Cette rencontre plus qu'' enrichissante lui permet de décrocher des rôles dans les deux films suivants du réalisateur : Tais-toi ! (2003) et La Doublure (2006). Il sera également de l''aventure théâtrale Le Dîner de cons (2007), lors de sa reprise avec Dany Boon et Arthur en têtes d''affiche.

Dito Montiel, born as Orlandito Montiel, (July 26, 1965) is an American author, screenwriter, director and musician.

Born in New York City, he came into the public eye after the breakup of his hardcore punk band Major Conflict. Later, Montiel would gain notoriety in 1989 when Geffen Records signed his newly formed outfit Gutterboy to a $1 million record deal – an unheard of sum at the time. The band was dropped after its debut and was dubbed one of the most "successful" unsuccessful bands in rock history.

In 2003, Montiel published A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, a memoir detailing his life growing up in Astoria, Queens in the early 1980s during the rise of the hardcore punk scene. The book describes his time spent touring with his band Gutterboy and his brief modeling career with Versace along with other personal anecdotes.

After adapting his best-selling book into a screenplay, Montiel made his directorial debut with the film version of A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, with Robert Downey Jr. (as the older Montiel), Dianne Wiest and Shia LaBeouf. The film was executive produced by Trudie Styler.

Montiel released the self-titled album Dito Montiel in 2006 through Rhino Records. His second novel Eddie Krumble Is the Clapper was published in April 2007.

Montiel also directed a film, Fighting, about a young street hawker in New York City who is introduced to the world of underground street fighting. The film stars Channing Tatum, Terrence Howard and Luis Guzmán.

In 2011, Montiel''s police drama The Son of No One, featuring Channing Tatum, Ray Liotta, Al Pacino and Katie Holmes played at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was picked up for distribution by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

Known for a series of sonically  innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as  well as elaborate stage shows, television and film roles, she has been a  prominent figure in popular culture for over 30 years. The youngest  child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame.

After signing a recording contract with A&amp;M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music.  In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her records,  choreography, music videos, and prominence on radio airplay and MTV, she was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics.

In 1991 she signed the first of two record-breaking, multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest paid artists in the industry. Her debut album under the label, Janet (1993), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in Poetic Justice;  since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the  1990s, she was named the second most successful recording artist of the  decade. The release of her seventh studio album All for You (2001) coincided with a celebration of her impact on popular music as the inaugural MTV Icon. After parting ways with Virgin she released her tenth studio album Discipline (2008), her first and only album with Island Records. In 2015 she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation.

Having sold over 160 million records, she is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists her as the eleventh best-selling female artist in the United States, with 26 million certified albums.

In 2008 Billboard  magazine released its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, placing  her at number seven, while in 2010, ranking her fifth among the "Top 50  R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years".

In a conversation with Irish drama critic Fintan O''Toole in BOMB Magazine, McDonagh said, "It''s not that I don''t respect theater. I''m intelligent enough to know that a play can completely inspire a person as much as a film...[but] theater isn''t something that''s connected to me, from a personal point of view, I can''t appreciate what I''m doing."

McDonagh won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for his first film, In Bruges.  His second film, Seven Psychopaths, will be released in September 2012.

He was also one of the founding members of SCH (band) and the frontman of Sarajevo rock band Bombaj Štampa. During the Yugoslav wars he moved to Slovenia. Notable films where he appeared have included: Time of the Gypsies (1988) (Dom za vešanje) Kuduz (1989) The Fall of Rock and Roll (1989) (Kako je propao rokenrol) An Additional Soul (1991) (Ovo malo duše) No Man''s Land (2001) (Ničija zemlja) Kajmak and Marmalade (2003) (Kajmak i marmelada) A Small World (2003) (Mali svet) Bal-Can-Can (2005) Triage (2009) Currently, Ðurić is married to Slovenian actress Tanja Ribič with whom he played with in Kajmak in marmelada and lives and works in Slovenia, where he leads Theatre 55, a film production company.

In February 2007, Ðurić has appeared on B92 television in Serbia in Ðurine žute minute short segments, a slightly different take on his widely popular "Ðurine kućne čarolije" sketch, which he performed in Top Lista Nadrealista. The segments mostly received poor reviews and were quickly taken off the air.

Unable to afford theater training after high school and in the middle of the Iranian hostage crisis he joined the US Army in hopes of later attending American Academy of Dramatic Arts in NYC.

The Army had different plans for Brian and after 2 yrs of infantry training, accepted him into US Army flight school at Ft Rucker, Alabama. Brian loved the intense academic environment and found he had a natural ability flying helicopters. Upon flight school graduation, Brian was accepted into the attack school where he was trained as a Cobra pilot then sent to a discreet Army base in the rural fields west of Nurnberg, Germany. The only American living in the small town of Oberntief at the time, Brian treasures those years and is always trying to live up to them. While in Germany, he studied full time at the satellite campus of Embry Riddle Aeronautical University near Nurnberg, and as an avid skier, racked up over fifty lift tickets in three years from the Austrian Alps to the Italian Dolomites. If he wasn''t flying, studying, or comparing stories over drinks at their remote officers club, he was traveling Europe with his fellow gun pilots. Despite an exciting and very rewarding career thus far, Brian knew it was time to become an actor soon and after seeing the movie Top Gun in Garmisch, requested his final assignment be as close to Hollywood as possible. Within a year, he was based at Ft Ord, CA and immersed himself in Monterey''s busy theater community whenever he could.

In Monterey, he got the part of Vince in Buried Child by falling down ''drunk'' on stage during his audition and completing the scene from the stage floor.

In late 1989, after 10 years of military service, Brian resigned from the Army, sold his new Saab for acting lessons in Hollywood, and made his move there.

October 30th 2009 marks both the theatrical release of the new film Boondock Saints 2, All Saints Day and the 20th anniversary of Brian''s arrival in Los Angeles.

Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky, known as Alejandro Jodorowsky (born 17 February 1929) is a Chilean filmmaker, playwright, composer and writer with a large cult following. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been "venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts" for his work which "is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation." His most notable works include El Topo (1970), The Holy Mountain (1973) and Santa Sangre (1989), all of which have had limited release but achieved popularity amongst various countercultural groups. He has cited the filmmaker Federico Fellini as his primary cinematic influence, and has been described as an influence on such figures as Marilyn Manson and David Lynch. After a failed attempt to return to filmmaking with a film entitled King Shot starring Marilyn Manson and produced by David Lynch, Alejandro is set to return to cinema with the sequel to El Topo entitled Abel Cain sometime in late 2011 or 2012.

Jodorowsky is also a playwright and play director, having produced over one hundred plays, primarily in Mexico where he lived for much of his life. Alongside this he is also a writer, particularly of comic books - his The Incal even has been noted as having a claim to be "the best comic book" ever written - as well as books on his own theories about spirituality. Jodorowsky has been involved in the occult and various spiritual and religious groups, including Zen Buddhism and forms of Mexican shamanism, and has formulated his own spiritual system, which he has called "psychomagic" and "psychoshamanism".

Kenney had originally collaborated at Harvard with friend, Henry Beard, and founded the National Lampoon, where the two pooled their talents and created a radical new humor magazine. Humor that was sophomoric, rebellious, off-color, vulgar and just plain laceratingly funny.  The Lampoon''s humor was considered radical. Not only was the magazine an all-time best seller - particularly the infamous cover of the gun pointed at the family pet: "If you don''t buy this magazine, we''ll kill this dog". Kenney had broadened his comic touch all over. He and other members of the Lampoon had written books - the most popular being the "1964 High School Yearbook Parody" in 1974 (co-edited by P.J. O''Rourke). Written like a real yearbook and spoofing all the things that make them almost embarrassing and funny in their own right, Kenney and his cohorts had certainly written a little masterpiece.  Another best-selling classic of his was the cult favorite "Bored of the Rings", a humorous little take on Mr. J.R.R. Tolkien''s legendary best-seller. The book was a best-seller and thanks to the release of Peter Jackson''s Oscar-winning live-action adaptation of the novel trilogy, the book got another printing. Kenney''s legacy was living on.

BAFTA award winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia is known for his visually striking films which explore the lives of ‘outsiders’, characters living in timeless, extreme and unforgiving circumstances or landscapes. His films have been awarded and distributed internationally and shown how versatile and expressive British cinema can be.

Born in Hackney, London in 1972, Kapadia studied filmmaking at the Royal College of Art where he first gained recognition with his short The Sheep Thief (1997) telling the story of a gifted street kid and the family who take him in, made with non professional actors in Rajasthan, India, the film won many awards including Second Prize at the 1998 Cannes International Film Festival Cinefondation, the Grand Prix at the 1997 European Short Film Festival in Brest & Best Director at the Recontres Henri Langlois Festival International des Ecoles de Cinema in Poitiers 1997.

Kapadia’s distinct visual style continued with his first feature The Warrior (2001, FilmFour), shot in the deserts of Rajasthan and the snow capped Himalaya. The Warrior was championed in the British Press as ‘epic’and ‘stunning’ (Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian) and was nominated for three BAFTA awards, winning two the Alexander Korda Award for the outstanding British Film of the Year 2002 and The Carl Foreman Award for Special Achievement by a Director, Screenwriter or Producer in their First Feature.

The Warrior also won the Grand Prix at the Dinard Film Festival, the prestigious Sutherland Award at the London Film Festival, the Evening Standard British Film Awards for the Most Promising Newcomer, the Douglas Hickox Award for Best Debut Film and the Technical Achievement Award for Cinematography at the British Independent Film Awards and the Jury Prize for the best cinematography at the San Sebastian Film Festival.

Far North (2007, FILM4), premiered at the Venice Film Festival, based on a dark short story by Sara Maitland. Kapadia used the epic and brutal arctic landscape to show how desperation and loneliness drive a woman to harm the person she loves the most.

Inspired by N.W.A, The Chronic, Doggystyle, and classic albums from 2Pac, the Notorious B.I.G., and Jay-Z, the Game began rapping in 2001 and never looked back. His barbed and bold freestyles caught the ear of Dre, who signed him to Aftermath in 2003 and executive produced his debut. It was delayed a few times, but The Documentary finally dropped in January 2005. Soon the Game and 50 Cent

 were at war over the former''s reluctance to beef with any and every 

enemy of G-Unit. Freestyles and mixtapes were spawned in amazing amounts

 from both sides, and every time a truce seemed possible, things fell 

apart at the last minute. Dr. Dre was stuck in the middle, and while he never publicly denounced the Game, he passed on working with the rapper for his next effort. Despite Dre''s absence, the Game''s sophomore release kept its original title of Doctor''s Advocate when it was released in late 2006. Two years later, LAX was released. With fewer mentions of Dr. Dre and 50 Cent,

 the uneven album found the rapper moving on from his previous 

obsessions. After periods of retirement talk, the MC had a change of 

heart and began recording The R.E.D. Album ("R.E.D." being short for "rededicated"), for a planned 2010 release. ', 'Los Angeles, California, United States', 1, '/rTigqGDu9vbM1FRVgbV1pqh8PwF.jpg'),

Considered a pivotal figure in the history of country music, Travis broke through in the mid-1980s with the release of his album Storms of Life on Warner Bros. Records; the album sold more than three million copies. It also established him as a neotraditionalist country act, and was followed by a string of several more platinum and multi-platinum albums throughout his career. Starting in the mid-1990s, however, Travis saw decline in his chart success. He left Warner Bros. in 1997 for DreamWorks Records; there, he would eventually switch his focus to gospel music, a switch which, despite earning him only one more country hit in the Number One "Three Wooden Crosses," earned him several Dove Awards.

Travis, in addition to singing, holds several acting credits, starting with his television special Wind in the Wire in 1992. Since then, he has appeared in several movie and television roles, occasionally as himself.

He obtained his B.A. in 1968 from the State University of New York at Buffalo (UB) in sociology. He then moved to Los Angeles, California.

He first gained connections in Hollywood by meeting Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Alice Cooper in 1968. He quickly became Cooper''s agent. Much of Coopers stage act and the band''s overall macabre persona was influenced directly by Gordon, who created many imaginative and wild events to get Cooper PR in the papers, including throwing a live chicken on stage. Gordon subsequently later represented many other celebrities such as Anne Murray, Blondie, Teddy Pendergrass, and Luther Vandross.

Gordon has worked on numerous film productions, typically as a producer. These include The Duellists and Kiss of the Spider Woman. He then created one of the first independent film production companies in the U.S., Alive Films.

His work was instrumental in bringing the modern wave of celebrity chefs into existence. He represented many of the top chefs of the world at a time when they were not known in popular culture, and, when the Food Network was first created, he brought many of them to the same, including Emeril Lagasse, helping to make them all the household names they are now. He owns multiple restaurants.

Ellory Elkayem (born 12 August 1970) is a New Zealand film director.

Born in Christchurch, Ellory Elkayem began making films at a young age. He later attended a film school designed to give students practical experience and preparation for a career in the film business. He learned the ropes firsthand while working in the camera department on many commercials, music videos, and television shows such as The Adventures of the Black Stallion starring Mickey Rooney.

During this time, Elkayem also made several short films with support and financial assistance from the New Zealand government. His big break came with Larger than Life, a 13-minute black-and-white, FX-driven homage to the 1950s Hollywood horror genre, featuring a giant, man-eating spider.

Produced by Academy Award winner Jamie Selkirk, and financed with the largest grant of its kind from the New Zealand Film Commission, Larger than Life received critical acclaim at the 1998 Telluride Film Festival and later caught the eye of the Hollywood producers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow), who then recruited Elkayem to write and direct Eight Legged Freaks, a $30 million feature film based on Larger than Life, starring David Arquette, Kari Wührer, and Scarlett Johansson, and distributed by Warner Brothers.

He has since worked on a number of low-budget horror films, including Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis and Return of the Living Dead: Rave from the Grave sequels and has just finished directing Without a Paddle: Nature''s Calling.

Mara Corday (born Marilyn Joan Watts on January 3, 1930 in Santa Monica, California) is a showgirl, model, actress, Playboy Playmate and a 1950s cult figure.

Wanting a career in films, Mara Corday came to Hollywood while still in her teens and found work as a showgirl at the Earl Carroll Theatre on Sunset Boulevard. Her physical beauty brought jobs as a photographer''s model that led to a bit part as a showgirl in the 1951 film Two Tickets to Broadway. She signed on as a Universal International Pictures (UI) contract player where she met actor Clint Eastwood with whom she would remain lifelong friends. With UI, Corday was given small roles in various B-movies and television series. In 1954 on the set of Playgirl she met actor Richard Long. Following the death of Long''s wife, the two began dating and married in 1957.

Her roles were small until 1955 when she was cast opposite John Agar in Tarantula, a Sci-Fi B-movie that proved a modest success. She had another successful co-starring role in that genre (The Black Scorpion) as well as in a number of Western films. Respected film critic Leonard Maltin said that Mara Corday had "more acting ability than she was permitted to exhibit."

Mara Corday appeared as a pinup girl in numerous men''s magazines during the 1950s and was the Playmate of the October 1958 issue of Playboy, together with famous model and showgirl Pat Sheehan. In 1956, she had a recurring role in the ABC television series Combat Sergeant. From 1959 to early 1961, Corday worked exclusively doing guest spots on various television series. She then gave up her career to devote her time to raising a family. During her seventeen-year marriage to Richard Long she had three children.

A few years after her husband''s passing in 1974, Corday''s friend Clint Eastwood offered her a chance to return to filmmaking with a role in his 1977 film The Gauntlet. She acted with him again in Sudden Impact (1983), Pink Cadillac (1989), and in her last film, 1990s The Rookie.

Brett Leonard (born May 14, 1959 in Toledo, Ohio, U.S.A.) is an American film director, producer and music video director specializing in the science-fiction and horror genres. A few of his films such as The Lawnmower Man and Virtuosity (1995) feature groundbreaking computer animation and visual effects. The Lawnmower Man is considered the first, seminal film to feature "Virtual Reality" as a cautionary tale becoming the number one commercially successful independent film of 1992, budgeted at just under $6 million and eventually earning over $150 million worldwide.

Virtuosity became the first major film to feature nanotechnology set in a cyberpunk based future with Brett Leonard casting Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington together a full 12 years before they would again co-star and many Oscar nominations later in a 2007 project.

His work with the IMAX 3D process set him apart from most directors having gained early experience with this cutting-edge presentation medium directing T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous in IMAX 3D. The film became the first number one hit 3D movie to gross over $100 million worldwide (on IMAX screens alone).

He created a sensation when he took his “Swarm Cam-Fusion Station” onto The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and guest Billy Idol, and implemented one of the first live web-casts ever, from the House of Blues, LA.

Creative Artists Agency and Intel Corporation hired him to direct a state-of-the-art "interactive show" for the CAA/Intel Media Lab to introduce the Hollywood community to the "future of entertainment" digitizing actor Danny DeVito, and using live performance animation to create the interactive animated character "Mr. Head", who guided the audience/participants through the experience.

In the music video genre Brett directed Peter Gabriel''s: Kiss That Frog, the first all computer graphic (CGI) music video / motion simulator ride film to tour the world becoming the wildly popular themed entertainment attraction to win him a 1994 MTV Music Video Award. Brett''s latest project is the documentary Hole in the Head.

Michael Wadleigh (born September 24, 1942) is an American movie director and cinematographer renowned for his groundbreaking documentary of the 1969 Woodstock Festival, Woodstock.

A native of Akron, Ohio, Wadleigh entered films in his early twenties as a cinematographer on independently-produced low-budget films David Holtzman''s Diary and I Call First (both 1967), and My Girlfriend''s Wedding (1969). Billed as Michael Wadley, he gained notice for his work from critics who followed independent and underground films, but the films, primarily aimed at a specialized and counterculture audience, brought him no financial success.

In April-May 1969, Wadleigh undertook the monumental task of documenting the rock music festival scheduled in the vicinity of Woodstock, New York on August 15-18. He arrived on the site in Bethel with over a thousand reels of film and a crew of several camera operators. The finished product was said to have consisted of about 120 miles of footage which, over the next months, was edited down to 184 minutes. Warner Brothers, the film''s primary financial backer, released it on March 26, 1970.

The film, which reportedly cost $600,000 to produce, earned over $50 million in the United States and more millions from foreign rentals, but due to a complicated arrangement with Warner Brothers, Wadleigh received only a small percentage of the profits. Woodstock stands as a milestone in the documentary film field, receiving an Academy Award for Documentary Feature at the 1971 ceremony.

Janis, a 1974 documentary about Janis Joplin, gave Wadleigh credit as cinematographer for his archive footage, but it would be eleven years after the release of Woodstock before he received his next and, last to date, directorial credit. Wolfen, a unique 1981 horror phantasmagoria based on the novel by Whitley Strieber, was praised for its dreamlike nature and striking visual quality, but despite a top-notch star turn from Albert Finney, turned out to have been too offbeat for the general public to achieve financial success. Wadleigh also wrote the Wolfen screenplay and has a bit part as "Terrorist Informer."

In August 1994, twenty-four years after its original showing, a 228-minute "director''s cut" of Woodstock was released, and in 1999, another Woodstock-based documentary, Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock gave Wadleigh another archive footage credit for cinematography.

Chapa was born in Dayton, Ohio, USA. He was briefly married to Natasha Henstridge. Among his earlier notable film roles are one of the leads in Taylor Hackford''s Blood In Blood Out and the part of Ken in the film adaptation of Street Fighter. Subsequently, Chapa has directed and produced, in addition to starring in, his own films. These movies include 1998''s Kill You Twice, 2000''s The Lonely Life of Downey Hall, 2002''s Man of Faith, 2004''s Shade of Pale, 2004''s El Padrino, and 2006''s I.R.A.: King of Nothing.

Chapa co-wrote and directed Polanski Unauthorized, a biopic of Roman Polanski, in which he played the title role. It was released on February 13, 2009, in Los Angeles, California. Chapa will begin filming the only film about Marlon Brando ever to be made, in June 2010 called Brando Unauthorized. He followed this with "Vatos Locos", starring himself. Albert Pyun was supposed to direct, but left the project following a dispute over his salary, so Chapa directed himself. The film is about the Chinese mafia in Los Angeles and how the Mexican gang boys, known as "vatos," fought back and defeated the Chinese gang-bangers.

As of 2011, Chapa has yet another project in development, an indie drama titled "The Best So Far," which takes place in the late 80''s, about a small-town Canadian girl who loves Judo and dreams about being one of the finalists at the ''88 Olympics. The ensemble drama follows the lines of Rocky, in the sense that it''s not about winning, but going the distance and getting your life back. Chapa, who wrote the drama, will play the widowed father, who does his best to make life easier for his daughter. Although the film is in its very early development stages, Chapa hopes the script will attract the interest of talented artists such as Ellen Page for the main role and Jennifer Connelly for the supporting role, this being the part of the final, toughest competition Page''s character faces off during the ''88 Olympics and gets defeated by. Although not winning, she gets her sense of victory be offering a brave stand against the better fighter, and both discover, in the process, they are quite simillar, despite their differences. Insiders who had a chance to read the script stated that it is one of the finest not-yet-filmed scripts they had ever seen. Acclaimed director David Cronenberg asked for New Line to bid for the script, but Chapa wouldn''t sell it, because of his determination to direct the picture himself. The project is slated to be shot sometime in mid-2012, for tentative release in 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival.

Colbert originally studied to be an actor, but became interested in improvisational theatre when he met famed Second City director Del Close while attending Northwestern University. He first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago; among his troupe mates were comedians Paul Dinello and Amy Sedaris, with whom he developed the critically acclaimed sketch comedy series Exit 57.

Colbert also wrote and performed on the short-lived Dana Carvey Show before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series Strangers with Candy. He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher Chuck Noblet. It was his work as a correspondent on Comedy Central''s news-parody series The Daily Show, however, that first introduced him to a wide audience.

In 2005, he left The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to host a spin-off series, The Colbert Report. Following The Daily Show''s news-parody concept, The Colbert Report is a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows such as The O''Reilly Factor. Since its debut, the series has established itself as one of Comedy Central''s highest-rated series, earning Colbert three Emmy Award nominations and an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents'' Association Dinner in 2006. Colbert was named one of Time''s 100 most influential people in 2006. His book I Am America (And So Can You!) was No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.

Al finalizar sus estudios de arte dramático, crea la compañía Nuevo Teatro, que le supone ser un renovador de la escena argentina de la década de los ''60. Su debut en los escenarios se produjo mucho antes, en 1948, cuando protagonizóProhibido suicidarse en primavera una obra escrita en 1937 por Alejandro Casona. En 1950 fundó la compañía Nuevo Teatro, la que tuvo a pleno rendimiento hasta 1968. Pero se hizo famoso sobre todo por sus trabajos en el cine que empezaron en 1965 con Todo sol es amargo, deAlfredo Mathé. En los siguientes años Alterio intervino en algunas de las mejores películas de la entonces nueva generación de cineastas argentinos. Ha hecho colaboraciones con Fernando Ayalaen Argentino hasta la muerte, 1970, Juan José Jusid en La fidelidad, 1970, Héctor Olivera en La venganza del Beto Sánchez, 1972 y La Patagonia rebelde, 1974, Oso de Plata en Berlín. Y el más destacado de ellos, Leopoldo Torre Nilsson en El santo de la espada, 1969, La maffia, 1971 y Los siete locos, 1972. En 1975, mientras se encontraba en España, fue amenazado de muerte por la Triple A,2 por lo que decide no regresar a su país, y residir desde entonces en España, donde consiguió también la nacionalidad española. Desde 1975, Alterio también ha tenido participación en muchas producciones españolas, dejando memorables creaciones en A un dios desconocido (1977) de Jaime Chávarri, con la que obtuvo el premio al mejor actor en el Festival de San Sebastián; El crimen de Cuenca (1979) de Pilar Miró; El nido (1980) de Jaime de Armiñán, película nominada al Óscar y premio al mejor actor de la Asociación de Cronistas de Nueva York; o Don Juan en los infiernos (1991) y El detective y la muerte (1994); ambas películas de Gonzalo Suárez. Sin embargo no dejó de participar en numerosas películas de su país de origen. Curiosamente, él fue uno de los protagonistas principales en cuatro de las primeras cinco películas de ese país que llegaron a ser candidatas en la instancia final del Óscar a la mejor película de habla no inglesa, e incluso una de ellas lo ganó. Dichas películas fueron: La tregua (1974), Camila (1984), La historia oficial (1985) (que ganó el premio), y El hijo de la novia (2001). Sus hijos, Ernesto Alterio y Malena Alterio también son actores.

Victor Rasuk (born January 15, 1984) is an American actor. Rasuk was born in Harlem, New York to Dominican parents. He has one brother, Silvestre, with whom he starred in Raising Victor Vargas. Rasuk attended performing arts school as a teenager, and began acting at 14. He garnered his first movie role at 16 in Five Feet High and Rising. The film—less than 30 minutes long—was a hit at the Independent Spirit Film Festival. Two years later, the same director, Peter Sollett, suggested expanding the short film into a feature-length movie: Raising Victor Vargas, which went on to win Rasuk an Independent Spirit Award for his work. In his next film, Rock Steady, Rasuk played a character named Roc. Two years later, he took a leading role in Haven with Orlando Bloom. In 2005, Lords of Dogtown was released, with Victor playing Tony Alva, one of the leading roles. The part included surfing and performing skateboarding tricks. Although the more complicated maneuvers were performed by stunt men (including the scenes of surfing at Pacific Ocean Park pier and skating in empty swimming pools), Rasuk is a method actor and worked on remaining in character both on and off screen. Believing he had mastered skating a huge ramp in only his second week of training, Rasuk fractured one of his orbital bones. Rasuk says the accident likely earned him more respect from serious skaters within the cast and crew. Victor can now be seen on the HBO television series How To Make It In America (2010), co-starring alongside Bryan Greenberg and rapper Kid Cudi. Marjorie Ballentine is his acting coach.

        (59874, 'Robert Downey Sr.', '1936-06-01', 'Robert John Downey Sr. (né Robert Elias Jr.) is an American filmmaker, director and writer. The father of actor Robert Downey Jr., he is best known as an underground filmmaker, serving as director and/or writer of such cult classics as Putney Swope, a satire on the New York Madison Avenue advertising world. According to film scholar Wheeler Winston Dixon, Downey''s films during the 1960s were "strictly take-no-prisoners affairs, with minimal budgets and outrageous satire, effectively pushing forward the countercultural agenda of the day." 

Downey was born in New York City, the son of Elizabeth (née McLauchlen), a model, and Robert Elias Sr., who worked in management of motels and restaurants. His paternal grandparents were Lithuanian Jews, while his mother was of half Irish and half Hungarian Jewish ancestry. Downey was born Robert Elias; but he changed his last name to Downey for his stepfather, James Downey, when he wanted to enlist in the United States Army but was underage at the time.

Robert Downey Sr. initially made his mark creating basement budget, independent films aligning with the Absurdist movement, coming of age in counterculture anti-establishment 1960s America. His work in the late 1960s and 70s was quintessential anti-establishment, reflecting the nonconformity popularized by larger counterculture movements and given impetus by new freedoms in filmmaking, such as the breakdown of Codes on censorship. In keeping with the underground tradition, his 1960s films were independently made on shoestring budgets and were relatively obscure in the Absurdist movement, finding cult notoriety.

In 1961, working with the film editor Fred von Bernewitz, he began writing and directing low-budget 16mm films that gained an underground following, beginning with Ball''s Bluff (1961), a fantasy short about a Civil War soldier who awakens in Central Park in 1961. He moved into big-budget filmmaking with the surrealistic Greaser''s Palace (1972). His most recent film was Rittenhouse Square (2005), a documentary capturing life in a Philadelphia park.

Downey''s films were often family affairs. His first wife, Elsie, appears in four of his movies, as well as co-writing one. Daughter Allyson and son Robert Jr. each made their film debuts in the 1970 absurdist comedy Pound at the ages of 7 and 5, respectively; Allyson would appear in one more film by her father. Robert Jr.''s lengthy acting résumé includes appearances in eight films directed by his father, as well as two acting appearances in movies where his father was also an actor (Johnny Be Good, Hail Caesar).

Moving to New York in 1955 to test her acting mettle, the slim-faced, honey-blonde actress began to find TV roles almost immediately (one of her first being a "Robert Montgomery Presents" episode) in between supplementing her income as a switchboard operator. Initially billed Diane Gentner, she changed it to Diana Hyland (taking her mother''s maiden name). Following a tour of the play "Look Back in Anger," she broke through quite impressively on the Broadway boards as the neurotic ingénue in the acclaimed 1959 Tennessee Williams production of "Sweet Bird of Youth" starring Paul Newman and Geraldine Page. Her role of Heavenly Finley could have made her a film star had she been allowed to take it the big screen, but Shirley Knight was given that honor.  In the early 60s, Diana focused on the small screen with strong, emotional roles on such soaps as "Young Dr. Malone" (1958) and "Peyton Place" (1964) (in a particularly showy role as a minister''s alcoholic wife). She also scored well in a series of guest parts, notably "The Twilight Zone," "The Fugitive," "The Alfred Hitchcock Hour" and "Alcoa Presents," the last for which she received an Emmy nomination. She was a particularly sought-after presence on medical shows as well, spicing up such popular tearjerkers as "Ben Casey," "Dr. Kildare," "The Doctors and the Nurses," "Medical Center" and "Marcus Welby, M.D.".  Strangely, Diana made noticeably few films during her career, her best showcase being that of the unconventional minister''s wife opposite Don Murray''s Rev. Norman Vincent Peale in One Man''s Way (1964). In addition to a small, downbeat supporting turn in The Chase (1966) starring Marlon Brando, Robert Redford and, Jane Fonda, she also co-starred with Fess Parker in the routine western yarn Smoky (1966). Remaining focused on TV, Diana continued to brightened up the TV medium into the 1970s with an emphasis on crime ("Kojak, "Harry O", "Cannon," "Mannix," etc.).
