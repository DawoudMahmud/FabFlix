Kathryn Card (October 4, 1892 – March 1, 1964) was an American radio, television and film actress who may be best remembered for her role as Mrs. MacGillicuddy, Lucy''s mother on I Love Lucy.

Her first screen credit was in 1945 for her role as Louise in the Corliss Archer movie Kiss and Tell, starring Shirley Temple as Corliss Archer. The next year she appeared in Undercurrent with Robert Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, and Robert Mitchum. Then, in 1949, Card gave an interesting albeit brief performance (uncredited) as an extremely polite but no-nonsense loan processor for prospective borrower Joan Bennett in The Reckless Moment.

On February 8, 1954, Card made her first television appearance in an episode of I Love Lucy. The installment, entitled "Fan Magazine Interview", featured Card playing a slatternly woman named Minnie Finch. The following year she was cast as a totally different character, Mrs. MacGillicuddy, Lucy''s bird-brained mother. She joined the Ricardos and the Mertzes in Hollywood when Lucy''s husband, Ricky Ricardo, was given the opportunity to star in a motion picture. Mrs MacGillicuddy would frequently annoy Ricky immeasurably by mistakenly calling him "Mickey" or mistaking him for his fellow bandleader Xavier Cugat. She portrayed that character in five episodes during the 1954-1955 season, and appeared in three more installments during the 1955-1956 season when the Ricardos and the Mertzes traveled to Europe. However, Card''s character never appeared again once both couples moved to Connecticut in the following year. She reprised that role for the last time in one episode of The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show entitled "The Ricardos Go to Japan", which also featured guest star Robert Cummings, in 1959.

In addition to I Love Lucy, Card guest starred on several other television shows. She made two guest appearances in 1959 on Perry Mason, as Hannah Barton in "The Case of the Deadly Toy," and Harriet Snow in "The Case of the Watery Witness." Other television appearances included Make Room for Daddy, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and Rawhide. Her final film appearance was in the 1964 MGM musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown.', 'Butte, Montana, USA', 1, NULL),

She recorded a solo album later, which was never released. After signing with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry.

She embarked on the California Dreams Tour, which grossed nearly $60 million worldwide. Perry re-released the album under the name of Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection on March 26, 2012, and the re-release has already spawned the number-one single "Part of Me".

Perry is the only artist to spend over 52 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, and has since heightened this to 69 weeks. As of 2012, Perry has been nominated for eight Grammy Awards. She was named 2011''s "Artist of the Year" by MTV. She has sold 37.6 million digital tracks in the United States and 11 million albums worldwide. Perry was a guest judge on the seventh series of The X Factor UK and the ninth season of American Idol.

Paul Douglas (April 11, 1907 – September 11, 1959) was an American actor.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as Paul Douglas Fleischer, Douglas began his career as a stage actor. He made his Broadway debut in 1936 as the Radio Announcer in Doty Hobart and Tom McKnight''s Double Dummy at the John Golden Theatre. In 1946 he won both a Theatre World Award and a Clarence Derwent Award for his portrayal of Herry Brock in Garson Kanin''s Born Yesterday.

Douglas began appearing in films in 1949. He may be best-remembered for two baseball comedy movies, Angels in the Outfield (1951) and It Happens Every Spring (1949). He also played Richard Widmark''s police partner in the thriller Panic in the Streets, frustrated newlywed Porter Hollingsway in A Letter to Three Wives, Sgt. Kowalski in The Big Lift, businessman Josiah Walter Dudley in Executive Suite and a con man turned monk in When in Rome. In 1950, Douglas was host of the 22nd annual Academy Awards. Douglas also worked on radio as the announcer for The Ed Wynn Show and he was the first host of NBC Radio''s "Horn &amp; Hardart Children''s Hour!". In April 1959 Douglas appeared as Lucy Ricardo''s television morning show boss in the "Lucy Wants a Career" episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour.

Douglas was originally cast in the 1960 episode of The Twilight Zone called "The Mighty Casey", a role written for him by Rod Serling, based on his character in Angels in the Outfield, but Douglas died the same week after production of the episode had been completed. His role was taken over by Jack Warden, and most of the episode was refilmed several months later.

He was married five times, last to actress Jan Sterling from 1950 until his death. They had a son, Adams Douglas (1955–2003).

Paul Douglas died on September 11, 1959 of a heart attack in Hollywood, California at the age of 52. Film director Billy Wilder and co-writer I.A.L. (''Izzy'') Diamond had just offered him the role of Jeff Sheldrake in the movie The Apartment that went to Fred MacMurray instead. Wilder later said: "I saw him and his wife, Jan Sterling, at a restaurant, and I realized he was perfect, and I asked him right there in the parking lot. About two days before we were to start, he had a heart attack and died. Iz and I were shattered."

Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American recording artist and entertainer. Born in McComb, Mississippi and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, Spears began performing as a child, landing acting roles in stage productions and television shows. She signed with Jive Records in 1997 and released her debut album ...Baby One More Time in 1999. During her first decade within the music industry, she became a prominent figure in mainstream popular music and popular culture, followed by a much-publicized personal life. Her first two albums established her as a pop icon and broke sales records, while title tracks "...Baby One More Time" and "Oops!... I Did It Again" became international number-one hits. Spears was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s.

In 2001, she released her third studio album Britney and expanded her brand, playing the starring role in the film Crossroads. She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone released in 2003, which yielded chart-topping singles "Me Against the Music", "Toxic" and "Everytime". After the release of two compilation albums, Spears experienced personal struggles and her career went under hiatus. Her fifth studio album, Blackout, was released in 2007 and despite receiving little promotion, it spawned hits "Gimme More" and "Piece of Me". In 2008, her erratic behaviour and hospitalizations caused her to be placed in a conservatorship. The same year, her sixth studio album Circus was released, with the global chart-topping lead single "Womanizer". After embarking on The Circus Starring Britney Spears, she released greatest hits The Singles Collection, which featured U.S. and Canadian number-one single "3". In 2011, Spears returned with her seventh studio album, titled Femme Fatale, which was released on March 29, 2011, including the lead single "Hold It Against Me" which has become Spears'' fourth U.S. number-one single. The album debuted at #1 on Billboard 200. This made Spears the only female artist ever to have six number one debut albums, and have seven albums debut in the top two spots.

Spears has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists in the history of contemporary music. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the eighth top-selling female artist in the United States, with 33 million certified albums. Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female artist of the first decade of the 21st century, as well as the fifth overall. She was ranked the 8th Artist of the 2000s by Billboard. In June 2010, Spears was ranked sixth on Forbes list of the 100 Most Powerful and Influential celebrities in the world; she is also the third most mentioned musician on the internet, according to Forbes.

John Joseph Edward “Jack” Cassidy (March 5, 1927 – December 12, 1976) was an American actor of stage, film and screen.

His frequent professional persona was that of an urbane, super-confident egotist with a dramatic flair, much in the manner of Broadway actor Frank Fay. Cassidy perfected this character to such an extent that he was cast as the legendary John Barrymore in the feature film W.C. Fields and Me. The role of the vain, shallow, buffoon-like newsman Ted Baxter on TV''s The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–1977) was written with Cassidy in mind. However, Cassidy turned down the role, feeling that it was not right for him, and the part went to Ted Knight. Cassidy later appeared as a guest star in a 1971 episode as Ted''s highly competitive and equally egocentric brother, Hal.

William Girdler (October 22, 1947 - January 21, 1978) was an American filmmaker. In a span of seven years, from 1972 to 1978, he directed nine feature films in such genres as horror and action. Girdler also wrote and produced three of his features, Abby, Sheba, Baby and The Manitou.

Girdler, born in Louisville, Kentucky started Studio One Productions in his early twenties, and directed his first feature a low-budget film entitled Asylum of Satan which was briefly released to theaters. Girdler''s second effort was a gory, if overlong slasher thriller entitled Three on a Meathook. Both Asylum of Satan and Three on a Meathook were filmed in his home town, and although both films received little notice, the films got the attention of Samuel Z. Arkoff and American International Pictures (AIP).

Girdler next directed three "blaxploitation" films. The first, in 1973, was a long lost thriller titled The Zebra Killer starring Austin Stoker. By coincidence, another Louisville native, Rich Miles, appeared in this picture in a small role as the local cop who discovers some of the bodies. Girdler''s next feature was an Exorcist clone titled Abby with Carol Speed in the lead role and co-starring William H. Marshall (from Blacula) and Oscar nominee Juanita Moore. Abby became Girdler''s breakthrough film. The picture opened in 1974 to major box office success, earning nearly $9 million. Warner Brothers thought Abby was too derivative of Exorcist and the film was suddenly pulled from theaters after two weeks. The last "blaxploitation" film Girdler directed was the Pam Grier vehicle Sheba, Baby and his first effort in the action genre. Sheba, Baby was another major hit in theaters, even though it is often cited as one of Pam Grier''s more weaker vehicles than her other similar themed action films Coffy and Foxy Brown. Girdler was then finished with his contract with Arkoff and AIP.

Girdler''s sixth feature was another action themed film starring Leslie Nielsen, in one of his more serious roles as an agent tracked by the government in the political thriller Project: Kill, which was given a limited theatrical release.

Grizzly, released in 1976, was Girdler''s most financially successful film. A Jaws clone from start to finish, the film was about an oversized grizzly bear terrorizing a National Park. The movie starred Christopher George, Andrew Prine and Richard Jaeckel and went on to become one of the most successful motion pictures of the year, earning an impressive $39 million worldwide. After this triumph, Grizzly''s producer and distributor, Edward L. Montoro and Film Ventures International decided to keep the financial profits. Girdler (and the film''s screenwriters/producers Harvey Flaxman and David Sheldon, who also worked with Girdler on previous films) sued Montoro and Film Ventures to have the profits returned. Girdler directed The Day of the Animals, another effort for Montoro which is sometimes cited as a sequel to Grizzly. The film had an all-star cast including Christopher George, Leslie Nielsen, Richard Jaeckel, Ruth Roman and Lynda Day George. It was Girdler''s second approach to nature-versus-man films, but was not as successful as Grizzly.

The Manitou was the last film directed by Girdler. Based on a best selling novel by Graham Masterton, and starring Tony Curtis and Susan Strasberg, The Manitou was perhaps Girdler''s most expensive production. It was acquired by AVCO Embassy Pictures and released in 1978 and was also a major hit in theaters. He was killed in a helicopter crash in Manila, Philippines on January 21, 1978, while scouting locations for his tenth film project.

At the urging of a friend, he brought the confidence and poise learned in the ring to the big screen. Among his most memorable performances are the terrifying Uber Immortal in Zack Snyder''s 300, the ominous and powerful Dredger in Guy Ritchie''s Sherlock Homes and the unstoppable Minotaur in Tarsem Singh''s Immortals. Maillet appeared in the 2006 film 300, an adaptation of Frank Miller''s graphic novel of the same name. He played the Über-Immortal, a savage berserker who was part of the enemy''s imperial guard In November 2008, during a fight scene for the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes, he accidentally punched Robert Downey Jr. in the face, bloodying Downey and knocking him down.[6] Downey later stated on an episode of the Late Show with David Letterman that Maillet was "10 times more upset about it" than he was.

Maillet played a Russian professional boxer who took a dive in the 2011 film The Big Bang. Later that year, he appeared in the film Monster Brawl as Frankenstein in a wrestling tournament of eight classic monsters that fight to the death. He played Polyphemus in the 2013 film Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, Blackwell in the 2013 film adaptation of The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, and the executioner in the 2014 film Hercules.  also had a recurring role on the Syfy original series Haven billed as a "Heavy", a thug for the series antagonist.

After the war he returned to the film  business, and when "talkies" came into existence, Chevalier traveled to  the US to break into Hollywood. In 1929 he was paired with operatic  singer/actress Jeanette MacDonald to make The Love Parade  (1929). Although Chevalier was attracted to the beautiful MacDonald and  made several passes at her, she rejected him firmly, as she had designs  on actor Gene Raymond,  who she eventually married). He did not take rejection lightly, being a  somewhat vain man who considered himself quite a catch, and derided  MacDonald as a "prude". She, in turn, called him "the quickest derrière  pincher in Hollywood". They made three more pictures together, the most  successful being Love Me Tonight  (1932). In the late 1930s he returned to Europe, making several films  in France and England. World War II interrupted his career and he was  dogged by accusations of collaboration with the Nazi authorities  occupying France, but he was later vindicated. In the 1950s he returned  to Hollywood, older and gray-headed. He made Gigi  (1958), from which he took his signature songs, "Thank Heaven for  Little Girls" and "I Remember it Well". He also received a special Oscar  that year. In the 1960s he made ke a few more films, and in 1970 he  sang the title song for Walt Disney''s The AristoCats (1970).

Collet was born in New York City. He has one younger sister, Jennifer (not an actress).

During his teen years, Collet decided to break into show business, and acquired an agent. His first film role was as "Paul" in the 1983 independent suspense/horror film/slasher film Sleepaway Camp. Collet remained in touch with his co-star from the film, Jonathan Tiersten, and they auditioned for shows together, encountering a number of rejections. Eventually, Collet landed the role of Neil Oxley in a 1984 CBS after school special called Welcome Home Jellybean. Following this early success, Collet landed other numerous roles in television and film, such as Jake Livingston in Firstborn, which starred Teri Garr and Peter Weller; Richard Jahnke Jr. in the 1985 TV film Right to Kill?; Paul Stephens in the 1986 film The Manhattan Project, starring John Lithgow; and Albert Kaussner in a mini-series by Stephen King called The Langoliers in 1995. His television appearances include guest roles in Magnum P.I., The Hitchhiker (1983), The Equalizer (1985), L.A. Law (1986), and MacGyver (1985).

BJ produced the controversial award-winning documentary feature film "Top Priority: The Terror Within", which premiered at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on May 16, 2012. "Top Priority: The Terror Within" was released theatrically in New York and Los Angeles and won a Best Picture award showcasing the government''s whistleblower retaliation against his wife Julia Davis, a former Customs and Border Protection federal agent.

BJ works as an Executive Producer, Producer, Director and Screenwriter, continually coming in on or under budget with all of his film and television productions. Bondable and bankable, he brings experience as a guild signatory with elite entertainment-industry unions. BJ has a degree in Communications and studied at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.

BJ was inducted into the Hollywood Stuntman Hall of Fame and served as a stunt double for five (5) Academy winners, Tom Hanks, Jack Nicholson, Tommy Lee Jones, Michael Caine and Art Carney. BJ''s two world records are still standing to date: 1) a high fall from a helicopter into the ocean from the height of 180 feet, 2) an aerial neck suspension beneath a helicopter at 70 mph, at 1,000 feet for a period of 20 minutes of a helicopter flight from Universal Studios to the Santa Monica Pier.

BJ Davis directed Brandon Lee, the son of martial artist, the incomparable Bruce Lee, in his first feature film, which catapulted him into the spotlight. BJ worked as a Stunt Coordinator and Second Unit Director with box office legends like Clint Eastwood and Oliver Stone. BJ has made numerous appearances in Star Trek films, including "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" as the scripted character Yeoman Burke along with the "Star Trek: Deep Space" television series for years. Paramount Pictures created a line of merchandise and other venues using BJ''s likeness as Yeoman Burke.

BJ Davis took an active position in the affairs of the Screen Actors Guild, when he served as secretary to Charlton Heston and Robert Conrad. Davis'' guild efforts successfully prodded the Screen Actors Guild to provide contractual representation for stunt coordinators and stopped the classification system of stunt players by SAG that would have denied women and minorities the right to work and career advancement. BJ founded the National League of SAG Stunt Performers and served as a former SAG Safety Representative and Legal Expert.

BJ and his wife, National Security/Counter-Terrorism/Immigration Expert Julia Davis are civil and human rights activists as prevailing whistleblowers reporting fraud, waste, government and judicial corruption, retaliation, publicly combating organized crime elements after being targeted by the Department of Homeland Security, NSA, IRS and others for Julia''s protected disclosures reporting a national security breach on July 4, 2004, at the US/Mexico border at San Ysidro, CA.

Depois que a família mudou-se para Tijuana, Santana começou a tocar em casas nocturnas e bares. Ficou em Tijuana quando sua família decidiu mudar para São Francisco, nos Estados Unidos, porém logo se juntou a eles. Em 1966, ajudou a formar a Santana Blues Band, nome posteriormente encurtado para Santana. A banda começou a tocar no Fillmore West Auditorium, onde muitas das grandes bandas de São Francisco começaram. A primeira gravação de Santana foi The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper, com Al Kooper e Mike Bloomfield.

Depois de assinar com a Columbia Records, Santana lançou um álbum auto-intitulado Santana. O grupo consistia, na época em: Carlos Santana (guitarra), Gregg Rolie (teclado e vocais), David Brown (baixo), Belen Garay (bateria), José Areas e Michael Carabello (percussão). Na turnê que fizeram para divulgar o álbum (que incluía os sucessos "Jingo" e "Evil Ways"), a banda tocou no Festival de Woodstock. A apresentação aumentou enormemente a popularidade do Santana. Santana se tornou um grande sucesso, tal como o álbum Abraxas, de 1970 (destacando a música "Oye Como Va") e Santana III, de 1971. Em seguida, a formação original do Santana se desfez. Gregg Rolie se tornou um dos fundadores da banda Journey.

Carlos Santana manteve o nome e utilizou diversos músicos diferentes para continuar a turnê pelo país, lançando vários álbuns. Durante este período, Carlos adotou o nome "Devadip", dado a ele pelo líder espiritual Sri Chinmoy. Vários álbuns foram lançados nas décadas de 1970 e 1980, incluindo colaborações com Willie Nelson, Herbie Hancock, Jones, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter e The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Em 1991, Santana apareceu como convidado no álbum "Solo Para Ti", de Ottmar Liebert, nas músicas Reaching Out 2 U e numa versão de sua música Samba Pa Ti. Carlos Santana foi incluído no Hall da Fama do Rock em 1998.

Carlos Santana lançou em 1999 o álbum Supernatural, que teve as participações de Rob Thomas, Eric Clapton e Lauryn Hill, ganhando prémios Grammy em nove categorias, no ano seguinte, igualando um recorde histórico que somente Michael Jackson detinha.

Ralph Ince (January 16, 1887 – April 10, 1937) was an American pioneer film actor, director and screenwriter whose career began near the dawn of the silent film era. Ralph Ince was the brother of John Ince and Thomas H. Ince.  Ralph Waldo Ince was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the younger of three sons and a daughter raised by English immigrants, John and Emma Ince. Sometime after his birth Ince moved to Manhattan where his entire family was engaged in theater work; his father as a musical agent and mother, sister Bertha and brothers, John and Thomas as actors. Ralph Ince studied art with cartoonist Dan McCarthy and for a while worked as a newspaper cartoonist for the New York World and later magazine illustrator for the New York Mirror and The Evening Telegram. At times over his acting and directing career Ince would continue to contribute cartoons to popular magazines of the day. Early on in his career Ince, who had done some stage acting as a child, was a member of Richard Mansfield''s stock company playing parts in The College Widow and Ben Hur.

Around 1906 Ince became an animator in the fledgling film industry working for Winsor McCay, but soon turned to acting and joined Vitagraph Studios where he became known for his portrayals of Abraham Lincoln in a series of one reel films. Ince began directing at Vitagraph around 1910 and was officially advanced to the director’s chair in 1912, though he still continued to act in many of his films and throughout his career. Ince would go on to direct some 171 films between 1910 and 1937 and appear in approximately 110 films over nearly the same time period.', 'Boston, Massachusetts, USA', 1, '/kJ0JwBGMxMqZWmQAOQkdZhyBlkc.jpg'),

Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (  born August 13, 1926) is a Cuban politician, socialist revolutionary, and former political leader of the country.  As the primary leader of the Cuban Revolution, Castro served as the Prime Minister of Cuba from February 1959 to December 1976, and then as the President of the Council of State of Cuba and the President of the Council of Ministers of Cuba until his resignation from the office in February 2008. He served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from the party''s foundation in 1961 until 2011. In 2006, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Raúl Castro, who is the current President of the Councils of State and Ministers, and who previously served under Fidel as Minister of Defence from 1959 to 2008.

While studying law at the University of Havana, he began his political career and became a recognized figure in Cuban politics. His political career continued with nationalist critiques of the president, Fulgencio Batista, and of the United States'' political and corporate influence in Cuba. He gained an ardent, but limited, following and also drew the attention of the authorities.  He eventually led the failed 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks, after which he was captured, tried, incarcerated, and later released. He then traveled to Mexico to organize and train for an invasion of Cuba to overthrow Batista''s government, which began in December 1956.

Castro subsequently came to power as a result of the Cuban Revolution, which overthrew the US-backed  dictatorship of Batista,  and shortly thereafter became Prime Minister of Cuba.  In 1965 he became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, and led the transformation of Cuba into a one-party socialist republic. In 1976 he became President of the Council of State as well as of the Council of Ministers. He also held the supreme military rank of Comandante en Jefe ("Commander in Chief") of the Cuban armed forces.

Following intestinal surgery from an undisclosed digestive illness believed to have been diverticulitis,  Castro transferred his responsibilities to the First Vice-President, his younger brother Raúl Castro, on July 31, 2006. On February 19, 2008, five days before his mandate was to expire, he announced he would neither seek nor accept a new term as either president or commander-in-chief.  On February 24, 2008, the National Assembly elected Raúl Castro to succeed him as the President of Cuba.  Castro is currently most active in commenting on world affairs, commonly in the form of his regularly published Reflections, articles offering his view on world events from US foreign policy to global warming.

Before that, he was Governor of the state of Arkansas. Inaugurated at age 46, he was the third-youngest president. He took office at the end of the Cold War, and was the first president of the baby boomer generation. His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has served as the United States Secretary of State since January 21, 2009, and was Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009. Both Clintons received Juris Doctor (J.D.) degrees from Yale Law School.

Clinton has been described as a New Democrat. Some of his policies, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance, while on other issues his stance was left-of-center. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. The Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus between the years 1998 and 2000, during the last three years of Clinton''s presidency. After a failed attempt at health care reform, Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 1994, for the first time in forty years. Two years later, in 1996, Clinton was re-elected and became the first member of the Democratic Party since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second full term as president. Later he was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice in a scandal involving a White House intern, but was acquitted by the U.S. Senate and served his complete term of office.

Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II. Since then, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to promote and address international causes such as treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming.

In 2004, he released his autobiography My Life, and was involved in his wife Hillary''s 2008 presidential campaign and subsequently in that of President Barack Obama. In 2009, he was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti. In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton teamed with George W.

Henry Jaglom is a London-born American film director and playwright.

Jaglom was born to a Jewish family in London, England, the son of Marie (née Stadthagen) and Simon M. Jaglom, who worked in the import-export business. His father was from a wealthy family from Russia and his mother was from Germany. They left for England because of the Nazi regime. Through his mother, he is a descendant of philosopher Moses Mendelssohn.

Jaglom trained with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York, where he acted, wrote and directed off-Broadway theater and cabaret before settling in Hollywood in the late 1960s. Under contract to Columbia Pictures, Jaglom featured in such TV series as Gidget and The Flying Nun and acted in a number of films which included Boris Sagal''s The Thousand Plane Raid (1969), Jack Nicholson''s Drive, He Said (1971), Dennis Hopper''s The Last Movie (1971), Orson Welles'' never-completed The Other Side of the Wind and more.

Jaglom''s transition from acting in films to creating them was largely influenced by his experience watching the Italian film 8½ (1963). “The film changed my identity. I realized that what I wanted to do was make films. Not only that, but I realized what I wanted to make films about: my own life, to some extent.”

Jaglom began his filmmaking career working with Nicholson on the editing of Hopper''s Easy Rider (1969), and made his writing/directing debut with A Safe Place (1971), starring Tuesday Weld, Nicholson and Welles. His next film, Tracks (1976), starred Hopper and was one of the earliest movies to explore the psychological cost on America of the Vietnam War. His third film, the first to be a commercial success, was Sitting Ducks (1980), a comic romp. 

Jaglom co-starred in four of his most personal films—Always, But Not Forever (1985), Someone to Love (1987) starring Orson Welles in his farewell film performance, New Year''s Day (1989), which introduced David Duchovny, and Venice/Venice (1992) opposite French star Nelly Alard.

In 1983, Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Orson Welles at Los Angeles''s Ma Maison. Edited transcripts of these sessions appear in Peter Biskind''s book My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles (2013).

As a playwright, has written four plays that have been successfully performed on Los Angeles stages: The Waiting Room (1974), A Safe Place (2003), Always—But Not Forever (2007) and Just 45 Minutes from Broadway (2009/2010). Jaglom is the subject of the Henry Alex Rubin''s and Jeremy Workman''s documentary Who Is Henry Jaglom? (1997).

Nancy Davis Reagan (born Anne Frances Robbins; July 6, 1921 – March 6, 2016) was an American film actress and the wife of Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States. She served as the First Lady of the United States from 1981 to 1989.  Davis'' film career began with small supporting roles in two films that were released in 1949, The Doctor and the Girl with Glenn Ford and East Side, West Side starring Barbara Stanwyck. She played a child psychiatrist in the film noir Shadow on the Wall (1950) with Ann Sothern and Zachary Scott; her performance was called "beautiful and convincing" by New York Times critic A. H. Weiler. She co-starred in 1950''s The Next Voice You Hear..., playing a pregnant housewife who hears the voice of God from her radio. Influential reviewer Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that "Nancy Davis [is] delightful as [a] gentle, plain, and understanding wife." In 1951, Davis appeared in Night into Morning, her favorite screen role, a study of bereavement starring Ray Milland. Crowther said that Davis "does nicely as the fiancée who is widowed herself and knows the loneliness of grief," while another noted critic, The Washington Post''s Richard L. Coe, said Davis "is splendid as the understanding widow." MGM released Davis from her contract in 1952; she sought a broader range of parts, but also married Reagan, keeping her professional name as Davis, and had her first child that year. She soon starred in the science fiction film Donovan''s Brain (1953); Crowther said that Davis, playing the role of a possessed scientist''s "sadly baffled wife," "walked through it all in stark confusion" in an "utterly silly" film. In her next-to-last movie, Hellcats of the Navy (1957), she played nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair, and appeared in a film for the only time with her husband, playing what one critic called "a housewife who came along for the ride." Another reviewer, however, stated that Davis plays her part satisfactorily, and "does well with what she has to work with."

Author Garry Wills has said that Davis was generally underrated as an actress because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her "greatest ambition" was to have a "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, "I was never really a career woman but [became one] only because I hadn''t found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn''t sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress." Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a "reliable" and "solid" performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode "The Long Shadow" (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and The Tall Man, until she retired as an actress in 1962.', 'New York, New York, U.S.A.', 1, '/uzU1DU7Cvye66gLHCLmOPnTMKbg.jpg'),

Donald Woods (born Ralph Lewis Zink, December 2, 1906 – March 5, 1998) was a Canadian-American film and television actor whose career in Hollywood spanned six decades.

Born in Brandon, Manitoba, Woods moved with his family to California and was raised in Burbank. A son of William and Margaret Zink, Presbyterians of German descent. His younger brother, Clarence Russell Zink, also became an actor (Russ Conway).

Woods graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and made his film debut in 1928. His screen career was spent mostly in B movies, for example as lawyer Perry Mason in the 1937 film The Case of the Stuttering Bishop. He also occasionally played major roles in bigger feature films like A Tale of Two Cities (1935), Anthony Adverse (1936), Watch on the Rhine (1943), The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1944), and Roughly Speaking (1945).

Of considerable importance to his acting career were several seasons as leading man with the Elitch Gardens Theatre Company in Denver, Colorado, where he performed in 1932, 1933, 1939, 1941, 1947, and 1948.

In the early days of television, Woods starred as the title character in the 1951 syndicated TV series Craig Kennedy, Criminologist, and he was the host of Damon Runyon Theater on CBS-TV. He played himself on the dramatic series Hotel Cosmopolitan, also on CBS, and he was one of three hosts of The Orchid Award on ABC-TV. He portrayed Walter Manning on Portia Faces Life on CBS.

He also appeared in such anthology series as The Philco Television Playhouse, Armstrong Circle Theatre, Robert Montgomery Presents, The United States Steel Hour, Crossroads, and General Electric Theater. On April 11, 1961, Woods appeared as "Profesor Landfield" in the episode "Two for the Gallows" on NBC''s Laramie western series. Series character Slim Sherman (John Smith) is hired under false pretenses to take Landfield into the Badlands to seek gold. Landfield, however, is really Morgan Bennett, a member of the former Henry Plummer gang who has escaped from prison. Slim has no idea that Lanfield is seeking the loot that his gang had hidden away. Series character Jess Harper (Robert Fuller), Pete Dixon, played by Warren Oates, and Pete''s younger brother soon come to Slim''s aid. The title stems from the talk that the undisciplined Dixon brothers might eventually wind up on a hangman''s noose.

Woods later was a regular in the role of John Brent on the short-lived series Tammy and made guest appearances on Bat Masterson, Wagon Train, Ben Casey, 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, Stoney Burke, Bourbon Street Beat, Bonanza, Coronet Blue, Ironside, Alias Smith and Jones, The Wild Wild West and Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law, among many others before retiring from acting in 1976.

Besides his film career, he also worked as a successful real estate broker in Palm Springs where he lived with his wife, childhood sweetheart Josephine Van der Horck. They were married from 1933 until his death and had two children, Linda and Conrad.

Betty Jane Kathleen Crowley (born December 26, 1931) was an American actress and was Miss New Jersey in 1949 and a contestant for Miss America in the same year (she came in sixth). After the pageants, she became an actress who specialized in being phenomenally seductive in TV series and movies. Most well known for playing a variety of sirens in TV''s Maverick (1957) opposite James Garner, Jack Kelly, and Roger Moore, she appears in eight episodes, a series record for leading ladies; "The Jeweled Gun" (with Jack Kelly), "Maverick Springs" (with James Garner and Jack Kelly), "The Misfortune Teller" (with Garner), "A Bullet for the Teacher" (with Roger Moore), "Kiz" (with Moore), and "Dade City Dodge," "The Troubled Heir," and "One of Our Trains Is Missing," with Kelly. Crowley made 81 television appearances on various series and appeared in twenty movies between 1951 and 1970 (one of her last movie roles was in Downhill Racer with Robert Redford). Many of her films were low-budget sci-fi and horror movies, but she seemed to appear in practically every narrative television series produced in the late ''50s and ''60s, including Bourbon Street Beat, Surfside 6, Hawaiian Eye, 77 Sunset Strip, Bat Masterson, Bonanza, Branded, My Three Sons, Donna Reed, Perry Mason, Checkmate, Bronco, Route 66, Thriller, Batman, Disneyland, Family Affair, Rawhide, The Lone Ranger, and many others.

Crowley was often confused with her acting contemporary Pat Crowley (frequently billed as "Patricia Crowley"), who appeared as guest leading lady in different episodes of many of the same television series and was not related. The two Crowleys were apparently never cast in the same episode.

In the Philip Roth novel American Pastoral, the protagonist marries Miss New Jersey 1949, in the book named Dawn Dwyer and having few similarities to Crowley''s post-Miss New Jersey life (including a poorer finish in the Miss America pageant).

A native of Philadelphia, she married actor Dave O''Brien in 1936, the same year they appeared together in the low-budget exploitation cheapie Reefer Madness, which in modern times has become a well-known cult film. She also appeared in another anti-marijuana film Assassin of Youth in 1937.

She often appeared alongside her husband in various ''B'' pictures and the Pete Smith series of comedy shorts, in which O''Brien played the lead on many occasions during the 1940s. After their divorce in 1954, Short retired from film acting, and died nine years later at age 47.

Aside from singing and performing in the celebrated ''Continental'' musical number in The Gay Divorcee (1934), starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Ms. Miles film career was brief, unremarkable and confined to low-budget ''B'' pictures. But she has something of a cult following nowadays for her performance in the infamous anti-dope exploitation movie Reefer Madness, made in 1936. It is she who appears in the film''s most remembered sequence, playing an increasingly frenzied piano solo while Dave O''Brien shouts "play it faster, faster!".

After a role in an Edgar Kennedy short in 1939 (Baby Daze), she retired from the screen.

She was first introduced to climbing while studying for her geology degree. In her early climbing years she aspired to every kind of climbing from bouldering to big walls, and even aid lines. The first American to rank 1st in an international bouldering World Cup, she has won many competitions indoors and out, and also excelled in outdoor bouldering – having climbed Midnight Lightning (v8) and Plain High Drifter (V11) (both considered elite level boulder problems) between 2000 and 2002, and was the first woman to succeed on the problem The Mandala (v12) in January 2008.

Rands has also had successes in traditional climbing, being the first woman to achieve the grade of E8, with ascents of The End of the Affair at Curbar Edge in October 2004, and Gaia at Black Rocks in April 2006, both in England''s Peak District; these routes are notorious as being both extremely hard and extremely dangerous, with a fall carrying the most disastrous consequences for the climber. She also made a fast all-free ascent of Saint Exupery Spire in Patagonia and has sport climbed 5.13d/5.14a in China.

Max Wagner (November 28, 1901 – November 16, 1975) was a Mexican-born American film actor who specialized in playing small parts such as thugs, gangsters, sailors, henchmen, bodyguards, cab drivers and moving men, appearing more than 400 films in his career, most without receiving screen credit. Newspaper gossip columnists noted his rise from playing "Gangster #4", with no lines, and not carrying a gun, to "Gangster #2", with both lines and a gun.

Wagner was one of five children, all boys, of William Wallace Wagner, a railroad conductor, and Edith Wagner, a writer who provided dispatches for the Christian Science Monitor during the Mexican Revolution. When he was 10 years old, his father was killed by rebels and the family moved to Salinas, California, where he met John Steinbeck, who became a lifelong friend. Steinback based the character of the boy in his novel The Red Pony on Wagner.

Under the name "Max Baron", Wagner acted in many Spanish-language versions of English-language films, which studios made as a matter of course in the early days of sound films, He also served as a Spanish language coach for other actors, and appeared in many of the "Mexican Spitfire" films starring Lupe Vélez, where he also served to monitor Velez''s Spanish ad-libs for profanity.

Other series that Wagner appeared in include the Charlie Chan films, and Tom Mix serials, as well as others made by Mascot Pictures Corporation. In the 1940s, Wagner was part of Preston Sturges'' unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in six films written and directed by Sturges, beginning with The Palm Beach Story

In 1940 during the filming of "The Mad Doctor", Wagner was credited for driving 50,000 miles as an on-screen taxi driver on the studio back lots of Hollywood. Since his appearance as a cab driver in Charlie Chan in Shanghai (1935), producers often cast him as a wise-cracking or henchman taxi driver. "I was cast as a taxi driver about five years ago", Wagner told a reporter. "And I was typed."

In 1952, Wagner began to appear on television, in episodes of such shows as The Cisco Kid, Zane Grey Theater and Perry Mason, playing much the same kind of parts he played in the movies.

He was a regular cast member on the western television series Gunsmoke, making nearly 80 appearances between 1959 and 1973. He also appeared in many episodes of The Rifleman, Bonanza, Cimarron Strip, The Wild Wild West and Maverick, including a guest-starring role in the 1959 Rifleman episode "Blood Brother." He also had roles in the original Star Trek and The Twilight Zone series. He appeared in more than 200 television episodes between 1952 and 1974.

Notable film roles for Wagner include a supporting role in the cult science fiction classic Invaders from Mars (1953), an actor playing a gangster in the film-within-a-film segment of Bullets or Ballots (1936), and the bull farm attendant in the Laurel and Hardy comedy The Bullfighters (1945).

Late in his career, he appeared in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). He also occasionally composed music, such as the Mexican folk ballad "Pedro, Rudarte y Simon" in the Western film The Last Trail (1933).

His films often featured sadistic authority figures, such as priests or judges, punishing anyone - usually young women - who doesn''t conform to their strict personal moral codes, but he has denied there being any political subtext to his films. Because of the speed with which he had to make his films, Walker often used the same reliable actors, including Andrew Sachs and Sheila Keith, the latter playing memorable villainesses in four of Walker''s pictures. Malcolm McLaren hired Walker to direct a documentary on The Sex Pistols entitled A Star Is Dead. Walker was an unlikely choice of director for this project and the deal fell through when the band split up. Walker''s work was reviled and condemned by some contemporary critics, while others were surprised to find relatively sophisticated subtexts in what were made and marketed as commercial exploitation films.

She appeared in 63 silent films and 56 talking pictures (known as talkies) over the course of her career.

She is famous for being one of the first actresses to appear on film in the nude, or nearly so, during the Roaring Twenties.

She is reported to have said, "A director is the only man besides your husband who can tell you how much of your clothes to take off."

Blythe began her stage work in such theatrical pieces as So Long Letty and The Peacock Princess. She worked in vaudeville as the "California Nightingale" singing songs such as "Love Tales from Hoffman".

After touring Europe and the States, she entered films in 1918 at the Vitagraph Studios in Brooklyn, then she was brought to Hollywood''s Fox studio as a replacement for actress Theda Bara.

As famous for her revealing costumes as for her dramatic skills, she became a star in such exotic films as The Queen of Sheba (1921) (in which she wore nothing above the waist except a string of beads), Chu-Chin-Chow (made in 1923; released by MGM in the US 1925) and She (1925).

She was also seen to good advantage in less revealing films like Nomads of the North (1920) with Lon Chaney and In Hollywood with Potash and Perlmutter (1924), produced by Samuel Goldwyn.

Other roles were as an opera star, unbilled in Garbo''s The Mysterious Lady. She continued to work as a character actress. One of her last roles was a small uncredited role in a crowd scene in 1964''s My Fair Lady.

Jack Norton (September 2, 1882 – October 15, 1958) was an American stage and film character actor who appeared in 184 films between 1934 and 1948, often playing drunks, although in real life he was a teetotaler.

Career

Jack Norton was born in Brooklyn, New York on September 2, 1882.

In his early career he had a vaudeville comedy act with his wife Lillian Healy. Norton made his Broadway debut in 1925 in that year''s edition of Earl Carroll''s Vanities, and also appeared in Florida Girl, which was produced and staged by Carroll.

Norton''s first film work was for a musical short, School for Romance, in 1934, in which a young Betty Grable appeared, but his scenes were deleted. His work survived to reach the screen in his next assignment, The Super Snooper, a comedy short, and in his third film, his first full-length movie, Finishing School, which featured Frances Dee, Billie Burke, Ginger Rogers and Bruce Cabot, Norton played a drunk, setting the pattern for many of his future performances. Although he also played stone sober characters as well, he was best known for his inebriated characterizations, and he improved his work by following genuine drunks around, picking up behavioral tips.

Norton worked continuously and consistently, sometimes appearing in as many as 20 films in one year, although many of his performances went uncredited. One of the few times he was credited as part of the main cast was in 1945 for the film A Guy, a Gal and a Pal In the 1940s, Norton was part of Preston Sturges'' unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in five films written and directed by Sturges. He is perhaps best known to modern audiences as A. Pismo Clam, the drunken film director whom W.C. Fields is hired to replace in The Bank Dick (1940).

In 1947, Norton retired from films due to illness, his last appearance being in Alias a Gentlemen, which was released in 1948, although he did make some live television appearances in the early 1950s.

Jack Norton''s final appearance would have been in the 1956 episode of The Honeymooners entitled "Unconventional Behavior", but age and infirmity had so overwhelmed him that he was literally written out of the show as it was being filmed, though Jackie Gleason saw to it that Norton was paid fully for the performance he was ready, willing, but unable to give.

Stepin Fetchit (May 30, 1902 – November 19, 1985) was the stage name of American comedian and film actor Lincoln Theodore Monroe Andrew Perry. Perry parlayed the Fetchit persona into a successful film career, eventually becoming a millionaire, the first black actor in history to do so. He was also the first black actor to receive a screen credit. Perry''s typical film persona and stage name have long been controversial, and seen as illustrative of negative stereotypes of Negroes. However, a newer interpretation of his film persona contends Perry was ultimately subversive of the status quo.

She began acting in the 1922 Gershwin Broadway musical comedy, The French Doll, in which she had one of the main roles, "Baroness Mazulier". She made her film debut in the 1924 silent film, The Humming Bird, where she was one of Gloria Swanson''s gang of thieves who turned into resistance fighters in World War I.

With the advent of talking pictures, and before dubbing came into general use, D''Ambricourt was used in several films which were the French version of English language ones, such as Quand on est belle (The Easiest Way — 1931), L''énigmatique Mr. Parkes (Slightly Scarlet — 1930), and Nuit d''Espagne (Transgression — 1931).

She appeared in over 70 films, including such classics as Casablanca, San Francisco, and To Have And Have Not, until about 1947, after which her film career began to decline. Her final role was in George Cukor''s Les Girls, starring Gene Kelly and Mitzi Gaynor, in which she played the wardrobe woman.

Following service as a corporal in the U.S. Army infantry in the first World War, Bridge joined a theatrical troupe. He dabbled in writing and in 1930 sold a script to a short film, Her Hired Husband (1930). He followed this with a B-Western script, God''s Country and the Man (1931), in which he made his film debut as an actor.

His extensive filmography attests to his versatility as a supporting actor and reliability as a bit player. Although Dorr''s screen roles are at times credited, the great majority of his work is uncredited, consisting of characters who have limited dialogue or appear briefly as extras.  Dorr was cast, often under contract as a "day player", in more than 250 films in just the 1930s alone, remarkably averaging a different role in a different film every two weeks for ten straight years. A very small sampling of those motion pictures include Riders of the Purple Sage, Union Depot, Central Airport, Helldorado, The Mighty Barnum, Murder in the Clouds, The Case of the Missing Man, Show Them No Mercy!, She Gets Her Man, Love Before Breakfast, Sinner Take All, Snowed Under, The Firefly, Expensive Husbands, Big City, Criminals of the Air, Dangerous Holiday, It''s All Yours, Captains Courageous, Missing Witnesses, Pardon Our Nerve, The Cisco Kid and the Lady, Test Pilot, Penitentiary, The Main Event, The Crowd Roars, Coast Guard, Sued for Libel, Gone with the Wind, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He also performed in several installments of the 1939 serial Mandrake the Magician, portraying Gray, one of many criminals battling the title character.

Dorr continued to appear regularly in studio productions throughout the 1940s, but with reduced frequency when compared to the preceding decade; nevertheless, he still added more than 140 Hollywood films to his résumé in that decade. His work on the "big screen" decreased even further in the 1950s as acting opportunities increased on television. He was, though, cast in at least 45 feature films and shorts during the 1950s, including small roles in some notable productions, such as Ace in the Hole, The Greatest Show in Earth, and East of Eden.  By the late 1940s and early 1950s, programming in the rapidly expanding medium of television attracted the talents of many experienced personnel in the film industry, including Dorr. His earliest work on television was in two 1951 episodes of the televised crime drama Boston Blackie, starring Kent Taylor. As with his film career, Dorr’s 15 years of being cast in television series consisted predominantly of brief appearances on screen and portraying characters who had relatively few lines. Yet, his characterizations on television, like in films, were highly diverse and can be seen in at least 84 episodes of Westerns, crime and detective series, courtroom and hospital dramas, adventure programs, and sitcoms of the period.', 'Boston, Massachusetts, USA', 1, '/l6iPmfBJvMLyTTcZkJZ4MNx1WaJ.jpg'),

The two made a casual stop by the studio of Mack Sennett,  where she was hired on the spot and made a bathing beauty in the  studio''s films. Fox went on to star as leading lady in many of the early  films of Buster Keaton, including 1920''s highly-regarded "Neighbors".

In 1924 she married film producer Darryl F. Zanuck, with whom she had three children, Darrylin (b. 1931), Susan Marie (1935–1980), and Richard Darryl  (1934–2012). Fox retired from acting, but was known as a  behind-the-scenes influence on her husband''s business decisions. The  couple separated in 1956 over the studio mogul''s affairs with other  women, though they were never legally divorced; but according to Zanuck  biographers, she cared for him at their home from the time he became  mentally incapacitated in the early 1970s until his death in 1979. She  was buried near Darryl Zanuck at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles.

Wild Bill Elliott (October 16, 1904 – November 26, 1965) was an American film actor. He specialized in playing the rugged heroes of B Westerns, particularly the Red Ryder series of films.  By 1925, he was getting occasional extra work in films. He took classes at the Pasadena Playhouse and appeared in a few stage roles there. By 1927, he had made his first Western, The Arizona Wildcat, playing his first featured role. Several co-starring roles followed, and he renamed himself Gordon Elliott. But as the studios made the transition to sound films, he slipped back into roles as an extra and bit parts, as in Broadway Scandals, in 1929. For the next eight years, he appeared in over a hundred films for various studios, but almost always in unbilled parts as an extra.

Elliott began to be noticed in some minor B Westerns, enough so that Columbia Pictures offered him the title role in a serial, The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (1938). The serial was so successful, and Elliott so personable, that Columbia promoted him to starring in his own series of Western features, replacing Columbia''s number-two cowboy star Robert "Tex" Allen. Henceforth Gordon Elliott would be known as Bill Elliott. Within two years, he was among the Motion Picture Herald''s Top Ten Western Stars, where he would remain for the next 15 years.

In 1943, Elliott signed with Republic Pictures, which cast him in a series of Westerns alongside George "Gabby" Hayes. The first of these, Calling Wild Bill Elliott, gave Elliott the name by which he would be best known and by which he would be billed almost exclusively for the rest of his career.

Following several films in which both actor and character shared the name Wild Bill Elliott, he took the role for which he would be best remembered, that of Red Ryder in a series of sixteen movies about the famous comic strip cowboy and his young Indian companion, Little Beaver (played in Elliott''s films by Bobby Blake). Elliott played the role for only two years but would forever be associated with it. Elliott''s trademark was a pair of six guns worn butt-forward in their holsters.

Elliott''s career thrived during and after the Red Ryder films, and he continued making B Westerns into the early 1950s. He also had his own radio show during the late 1940s. His final contract as a Western star was with Monogram Pictures, where budgets declined as the B Western lost its audience to television. When Monogram became Allied Artists Pictures Corporation in 1953, it phased out its Western productions, and Elliott finished out his contract playing a homicide detective in a series of five modern police dramas, his first non-Westerns since 1938.

Elliott retired from films (except for a couple of TV Western pilots which were not picked up). He worked for a time as a spokesman for Viceroy cigarettes and hosted a local TV program in Las Vegas, Nevada, which featured many of his Western films.', 'Pattonsburg, Missouri, USA', 1, '/ohizyJvqnkCbIukx75jtDIKGmcJ.jpg'),

Rasumny was born in Odessa, son of the famous cantor Solomon (Ephroim Zalmen) Razumny, who was chief cantor of the choral synagogues in Kishinev, Nikolayev and Odessa. After the death of his father in 1905 he moved to Saint Petersburg, where he began his theatrical career. He later moved to Moscow and emigrated to Berlin in 1927. In 1933 he opened in Paris a Yiddish revue theater "Der kundes", in 1934 another Yiddish company "Parizer Azazel", then in 1938 in New York — Yidishe dramatishe studie (Yiddish Dramatic Studio).

Bess Flowers (November 23, 1898 – July 28, 1984) was an American actress. By some counts considered the most prolific actress in the history of Hollywood, she was known as "The Queen of the Hollywood Extras," appearing in over 700 movies in her 41 year career.

Born in Sherman, Texas, Flowers''s film debut came in 1923, when she appeared in Hollywood. She made three films that year, and then began working extensively. Many of her appearances are uncredited, as she generally played non-speaking roles.

By the 1930s, Flowers was in constant demand. Her appearances ranged from Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford thrillers to comedic roles alongside of Charley Chase, the Three Stooges, Leon Errol, Edgar Kennedy, and Laurel and Hardy.

She appeared in the following five films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture: It Happened One Night, You Can''t Take it with You, All About Eve, The Greatest Show on Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. In each of these movies, Flowers was uncredited. Including these five movies, she had appeared in twenty-three Best Picture nominees in total, making her the record holder for most appearances in films nominated for the award. Her last movie was Good Neighbor Sam in 1964.

Flowers''s acting career was not confined to feature films. She was also seen in many episodic American TV series, such as I Love Lucy, notably in episodes, "Lucy Is Enceinte" (1952), "Ethel''s Birthday" (1955), and "Lucy''s Night in Town" (1957), where she is usually seen as a theatre patron.

Louis J. Gasnier (15 September 1875 - 15 February 1963) was a French film director.

Born in Paris, Gasnier was working in theatre when Pathé hired him to direct films in the earliest days of cinema. He directed comedian Max Linder in many of his early short comedies. In 1912 he emigrated to the United States, where he made his name working on several fairly prestigious productions, most notably the serial The Perils of Pauline starring Pearl White, with whom he made several other star vehicles.

Gasnier''s career declined with the advent of sound, and he was later confined to making low-budget B movies. Arguably his most famous film, although not for artistic reasons, is the anti-marijuana opus Reefer Madness, made in 1936. The film''s over-preachy, over-the-top propaganda message has earned it a dedicated cult following, which remains strong to the present day. It is widely available in the public domain and on DVD, and has been frequently shown on many terrestrial and cable TV channels, quite remarkable for an ultra cheap exploitation movie of the 1930s that apparently had very scant distribution when it was originally released. After Reefer Madness, Gasnier made an additional eight films before retiring in 1941. He died in Hollywood at the age of 87.

Early life

Léa Seydoux is the daughter of businessman Henri Seydoux and Valérie Schlumberger. She has five younger siblings and an older sister, Camille. Seydoux was born in the Parisian district of Passy, but grew up in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Her parents divorced when she was a small child. Through her family involvement in media and entertainment, Seydoux grew up acquainted with prominent artists such as photographer Nan Goldin, Lou Reed, and Mick Jagger.

The Seydoux family is widely known in France. Her grandfather, Jérôme Seydoux, is the chairman of Pathé; her granduncle, Nicolas Seydoux, is the chairman of Gaumont Film Company;her other granduncle, Michel Seydoux, also a cinema producer, is currently the chairman of the Lille football club, LOSC; and her father is CEO of the French wireless company Parrot.

Her mother Valérie Schlumberger is a former actress and the founder of the boutique CSAO (Compagnie d''Afrique du Sénégal et de l''Afrique de l''ouest), which promotes the work of African artists, and Seydoux once worked as a model for their jewelry line Jokko. Schlumberger, who lived in Senegal as a teenager, is also the founder of the charitable organization ASAO (Association pour le Sénégal et l''Afrique de l''Ouest).

Seydoux describes her youthful self as short-haired, slightly disheveled, and widely viewed as a bit strange: "People liked me, but I always felt like a misfit." Still concerned for her shyness in adulthood, Seydoux has admitted to having had an anxiety crisis during the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.', 'Passy, Paris, France', 4, '/xptyFXfBENBMQkgPEYCxlMkSLSs.jpg'),

Raúl Ernesto Ruiz Pino (French: Raoul Ruiz; 25 July 1941 – 19 August 2011) was an experimental Chilean filmmaker, writer and teacher whose work is best known in France. He directed more than 100 films.

Ruiz spent some years at the Catholic University of Santa Fe, Argentina''s cinema school. Back in Chile, he directed his first feature film Tres tristes tigres in the late 1960s, winning the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival. He was something of an outsider among the politically oriented filmmakers of his generation, such as Miguel Littín and Helvio Soto, his work being far more ironic, surrealistic, and experimental. In 1973, after the coup d''état led by the dictator Augusto Pinochet, he left Chile and settled in France.  After several years producing and directing low-budget telefilms, he began working with larger budgets and "name" stars in 1996 with Three Lives and Only One Death. The following year he directed Genealogies of a Crime, starring Catherine Deneuve. John Malkovich starred in Le temps retrouvé, Les Âmes fortes and Klimt.

Steve James is an American film producer and director of several documentaries, including the award-winning Hoop Dreams and Stevie. He is also the director of the 1997 feature film Prefontaine. His newest film, The Interrupters, a portrayal of a year inside the lives of former gang members in Chicago who now intervene in violent conflicts, will be released in 2011 after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is his sixth feature length collaboration with his long-time filmmaking home, the non-profit Chicago production studio Kartemquin Films, and is also his fifth feature to be accepted into the Sundance Film Festival.

He is a graduate of Southern Illinois University Carbondale, studying with Charles Harpole. His work, he tells journalist Robert K. Elder in an interview for The Film That Changed My Life, was strongly influenced by the film Harlan County, USA.

There’ve been many documentaries over the years that have powerfully impacted me. I think this one came along at the time when I was more interested in being a feature filmmaker than a documentary filmmaker. So it came along at the beginning of a process of moving from an interest in feature film to documentaries, and that’s where my career has taken me. It came along at the right time for me. It helped me see, “Ah, this is more what I want to do.”

Steve James also pulls influence from the original definition of the term cinema verite as it applies to the Rouch/Morin method of filmmaking. Just as with Rouch and Morin, the “people on camera and we in the audience are continually reminded that a film is being made, that we are watching a film.” We are reminded of this through James’ presence on screen as well as his cinematic editing techniques, in order to obtain, what he believes is a more accurate depiction of truth.

Michael Allan "Mike" Patton (born January 27, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and actor, best known as the lead singer of the rock band Faith No More. He has also sung for Mr. Bungle, Tomahawk, Lovage, Fantômas, The Dillinger Escape Plan and Peeping Tom.

Known for his eclectic influences and experimental projects, Patton has earned critical praise for his vocals; which touch on crooning, falsetto, opera, death growls, rapping, screaming, mouth music, beatboxing, and scatting, among other techniques. Critic Greg Prato writes, "Patton could very well be one of the most versatile and talented singers in rock music." While commenting on Patton''s extended and diverse music groups, Allmusic called him "a complete and utter musical visionary and a mind-blowing and standard-warping genius."

He has many producer or co-producer credits with artists such as John Zorn, Sepultura, Melvins, Melt-Banana and Kool Keith. He co-founded Ipecac Recordings with Greg Werckman in 1999, and has run the label since.

William "Billy" Frank Jones, better known as Christopher Jones, was an American character actor, born August 18, 1941 in Jackson, Tennessee. With looks and a manner strikingly reminiscent of the late James Dean, Jones came from a similar background to Dean''s, but his interest in the arts began with drawing, which earned him an Art school scholarship in his teens. Jones''s enjoyment of movies interested him in acting, and he began to study filmed performances, particularly those of James Dean (East of Eden) and Elvis Presley (Love Me Tender), whom he considered his first idol. After serving briefly in the United States Army (and going AWOL to visit Dean''s family in Fairmount, Indiana), Jones studied painting in New York City, then began acting classes. Befriended by Frank Corsaro, who had also been a friend of Dean''s, Jones (adopting the stage name Christopher) made his Broadway debut on December 17, 1961, in Tennessee Williams''s The Night of the Iguana, directed by Corsaro and starring actress Shelley Winters. Winters introduced Jones to Susan Strasberg, an actress herself, and the daughter of Method acting progenitor Lee Strasberg. Jones went on to study at Strasberg''s Actors Studio, and despite personal friction between Lee and himself, "Chris" went on to marry Susan in 1965. The couple had a daughter, named Jennifer Robin Jones, in 1966. Moving to Hollywood, Jones was cast in the title role of an ABC television series, The Legend of Jesse James (produced by 20th Century Fox), which ran for thirty-four episodes in the 1965-1966 season. When the series ended, he accepted the role of Strasberg''s lover/husband in the movie Chubasco. The marriage did not long survive the filming, for the couple divorced in 1968. Jones''s next acting job, as rock star and Presidential wannabe Max Frost in the 1968 cult classic Wild in the Streets (costarring Shelley Winters), propelled Jones to the peak of his stardom. He appeared later that same year with Yvette Mimieux, in the sex comedy Three in the Attic. Jones also became friends with actress Sharon Tate and her husband Roman Polanski.

Jill Esmond (26 January 1908 – 28 July 1990) was an English actress and first wife of Sir Laurence Olivier.

In 1928 Esmond (billed as Jill Esmond Moore) appeared in the production of Bird in the Hand, where she met fellow cast member Laurence Olivier for the first time. Three weeks later, he proposed to her. In his autobiography Olivier later wrote that he was smitten with Esmond, and that her cool indifference to him did nothing but further his ardour. When Bird in the Hand was being staged on Broadway, Esmond was chosen to join the American production – but Olivier was not.

Determined to be near Esmond, Olivier travelled to New York City where he found work as an actor. Esmond won rave reviews for her performance. Olivier continued to follow Esmond, and after proposing to her several times, she agreed and the couple were married on 25 July 1930 at All Saints'', Margaret Street; within weeks, the couple regretted their marriage. They had one son, Tarquin Olivier (born 21 August 1936).

Returning to the United Kingdom, Esmond made her film debut with a starring role in an early Alfred Hitchcock film The Skin Game (1931), and over the next few years appeared in several British and (pre-Code) Hollywood films, including Thirteen Women (1932). She also appeared in two Broadway productions with Olivier, Private Lives in 1931 with Noël Coward and Gertrude Lawrence and The Green Bay Tree in 1933.

Esmond''s career continued to ascend while Olivier''s own career languished, but after a couple of years, when his career began to show promise, she began to refuse roles. Esmond had been promised a role by David O. Selznick in A Bill of Divorcement (1932) but at only half-salary. Olivier had discovered that Katharine Hepburn had been offered a much greater salary, and convinced Esmond to turn down the role.

Wanda is an semi-autobiographical portrait of a "passive, disconnected coal miner''s wife who attaches herself to a petty crook."[4] Innovative in its cinéma vérité style, it was one of the few American films directed by a woman to be theatrically released at that time.

George Kirby (June 8, 1923 – September 30, 1995) was an American comedian, singer, and actor from Chicago, Illinois.

Kirby broke into show business in the 1940s at the Club DeLisa, a South Side establishment that employed a variety-show format and preferred to hire local singers, dancers, and comedians. His first recording was as a stand-up blues singer, performing "Ice Man Blues" on a Tom Archia session done in 1947 for Aristocrat Records.

He was one of the first African-American comedians to begin to appeal to white as well as black audiences during the height of the Civil Rights era, appearing between 1966 and 1972 on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show, The Jackie Gleason Show, Rowan and Martin''s Laugh-In, and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. He was an excellent impressionist — targeting, somewhat scandalously for the time, many white actors such as John Wayne and Walter Brennan rather than solely black stars such as Bill Cosby and Pearl Bailey — and, for a man of his ample girth, an unexpectedly agile dancer. He also did vocal impressions of such singers as Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald.

In 1970, he was allowed to produce a television special, The George Kirby Show, to gauge whether he could attract an audience for a weekly series. This led to his hosting a sketch comedy and variety show, Half the George Kirby Comedy Hour, which lasted for 22 episodes in 1972; it was also one of the actor-comedian Steve Martin''s first credits in front of the camera. The series was in many ways an uneasy compromise between Kirby''s natural gifts and what the public would accept of black actors at the time; a regular feature was a shaggy dog story segment entitled the "Funky Fable". He was also a regular in the British-produced ABC Comedy Hour series The Kopycats, alongside such other impressionists as Rich Little, Charlie Callas, Marilyn Michaels, and Frank Gorshin.

Following the demise of his show, Kirby''s career declined, especially as audiences began to look for more cutting-edge comedy. He had been an occasional drug addict; now, to make up for lost income, he took to selling drugs. In 1977 he sold heroin to an undercover cop; he plea bargained to a ten year prison term and was released after 42 months. His career never again reached its former heights, but he did register featured guest appearances on Gimme a Break with Nell Carter, Crazy Like a Fox, and 227. He then took ill with what was later diagnosed as Parkinson''s Disease. He was well-loved enough within the comedy community that friends and admirers formed the "Friends of George Kirby", which performed an all-star tribute to him in 1995 to help pay his mounting medical bills, only a few months before he died.

After appearing in only a couple of features she was snatched up by Vivid for an exclusive contract. One look at this ravishing stunner is enough to convince you that they made the right move. It''s very rare that a woman this beautiful gets into porn, and when she does it''s usually a safe bet that shes headed for superstardom. Devon is all that and more, a wonderfully expressive sex kitten who just happens to also be one of the most breathtaking women in the business. Devon was born on March 28, 1978 in Allentown, Pennsylvania. By the time she turned eighteen Devon had blossomed into the stunning 5''2" beauty we see today. She sports some head-turning 34D-24-34 curves, and somehow her Dutch/French/Cherokee/English heritage resulted in a pure Midwestern blonde bombshell. Devon got into hardcore at the urging of her then-boyfriend, who certainly knew her passionate potential. Within months of starting in the biz Devon had already become one of the most sought-after starlets around. Devon''s first foray into porn was in 1998''s "New Breed." In that flick she showed off some startlingly hot oral skills. Devon was quickly signed up by Vivid and began making top-of-the-line features filled with out-there sexual antics. Among her best flicks so far is "Country Comfort," in which she joins Bobby Vitale for a heated outdoor tangle, then returns later on to team up with Halli Aston, Gwen Summers and Julian in a frantic and frenzied fourway fiesta. Devon''s turn in "On The Street" is another winner. She plays a street kid who''s picked up by limo-riding Jeanna Fine and Tony Tedeschi, and she''s more than happy to hook up with the porno vets in a steamy back seat threeway. Later on Devon and Chloe engage in an amazingly arousing lesbian liaison, and Devon returns again for a blistering finale with Bobby Vitale. Devon''s pair of torrid threesomes in "Three" also stand out, especially her ravenous romp with Inari Vachs and James Bonn. Devon''s easily one of the best looking young women currently in porn, and it''s no surprise that Vivid got her name on an exclusive deal. She displays a combination of wholesome good looks and down-and-dirty debauchery that''s all too rare in this business. As long as she chooses to stick with it, Devon''s sure to be one of the favorites among fans, costars and producers alike.', 'Allentown, Pennsylvania, USA', 1, '/uMgo2hdU0n5RidJx8gKYVjbr1VZ.jpg'),

I started dancing at the age of 4 and was often involved in performances at the school or local fete. One of my favourite memories is singing ‘Halfway up the Stairs’ in front of my class, with my Kermit the Frog hand puppet. From that little performance came my ever increasing fascination with ‘The Muppet Show’.

At 8, I started at the Arts Educational School in Tring, where my main focus was ballet. My love of Theatre was born, when at 12 I was cast as “first mouse” for the Royal Festival Ballets “Nutcracker” at the Royal Festival Hall to approximately 2000 people per show !

I then attended The Central School of Ballet which was founded and run by the late Christopher Gable. In the 3rd year I toured with the school’s company in their “World on Fire” production. Touring was a great experience, but I will never forget locking myself out of my digs in Warminster! I was too busy chatting to the local Ghurkhas’ over a pint or 3. Having shinned up the back gate and jumped down through the open window, I realised I had entered the bedroom of the rather shocked Headmasters wife. She was remarkably calm though, as I made my sincere apologies and attempted to exit through her wardrobe!

My first professional stage job was the back end of Maggie the Cow at Watford Palace. Always good to start at the bottom and work your way up! Then I joined the NYMT for a season at the Edinburgh Festival. This was when I discovered my granny voice!! I played opposite Jonny Lee Miller in Bertolt Brechts Caucasian Chalk Circle, playing Granny Grusinia and other parts. The NYMT also produced “Joseph and his amazing Technicolor Dream Coat” that year, featuring Jude Law!

I have had the privilege of working with some amazing and talented people in theatre .Not least when I was cast in Cameron Macintosh’s “Oliver” directed by Sam Mendes. Working with the different “Fagins” and all those “Nancy’s”! I then swapped my corset for another Cameron show, “Martin Guerre”.

Pippen, along with Michael Jordan, played an important role in transforming the Bulls team into a vehicle for popularizing the NBA around the world during the 1990s.

Considered one of the best small forwards of all time, Pippen was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team eight times (all consecutive) and the All-NBA First Team three times. He was a seven-time NBA All Star and was the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1994. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History during the 1996–97 season, and is one of four players to have his jersey retired by the Chicago Bulls (the others being Jerry Sloan, Bob Love, and Michael Jordan). During his seventeen-year career, he played twelve seasons with the Chicago Bulls, one with the Houston Rockets and four with the Portland Trail Blazers, making the postseason sixteen straight times. He is third on the list of most postseason games played, behind Robert Horry and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

Sir Harry Donald Secombe, CBE (8 September 1921 – 11 April 2001) was a Welsh comedian and singer. He played Neddie Seagoon, a central character in the BBC radio comedy series The Goon Show (1951–60). He also appeared in musicals and films and, in his later years, was a presenter of television shows incorporating hymns and other devotional songs.

With the success of The Goon Show, Secombe developed a dual career as both a comedy actor and a singer. At the beginning of his career as an entertainer, his act would end with a joke version of the duet Sweethearts, in which he sang both the baritone and falsetto parts. Trained under Italian maestro Manlio di Veroli, he emerged as a bel canto tenor (characteristically, he insisted that in his case this meant "can belto") and had a long list of best-selling record albums to his credit.

In 1958 he appeared in the film Jet Storm, which starred Dame Sybil Thorndike and Richard Attenborough and in the same year Secombe starred in the title role in Davy, one of Ealing Studios'' last films.

In 1963 he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

He was knighted in 1981, and jokingly referred to himself as Sir Cumference (in recognition of his rotund figure). The motto he chose for his coat of arms was "GO ON", a reference to goon.', 'Swansea, Wales, UK', 1, '/9oNXrtoLX3OVrzvRMaetLN9Fieo.jpg'),

Luise Rainer (/ˈraɪnər/; January 12, 1910 – December 30, 2014) was a German-American film actress. She was the first actor to win more than one Academy Award; at the time of her death she was the longest-lived Oscar recipient.

Her training began in Germany from the age of 16 by leading stage director Max Reinhardt. After a few years, she became recognized as a "distinguished Berlin stage actress", acting with Reinhardt''s Vienna theater ensemble. Critics "raved" about her stage and film acting quality, leading MGM to sign her to a three-year contract and bring her to Hollywood in 1935. A number of filmmakers anticipated she might become another Greta Garbo, MGM''s leading female star.

Her first American role was in the film Escapade (1935), which was soon followed with a relatively small part in the musical biopic The Great Ziegfeld (1936). Despite her limited appearances in the film, she "so impressed audiences" that she won the Oscar for Best Actress. For her dramatic telephone scene in the film, she was later dubbed "the Viennese teardrop". In her next role, producer Irving Thalberg was convinced, despite the studio''s disagreement, that she could play the part of a poor uncomely Chinese farm wife in The Good Earth, based on Pearl Buck''s novel about hardship in China. The subdued character she played was such a dramatic contrast to her previous, vivacious character, that she won another Academy Award, even with Greta Garbo as one of the nominees.

However, she would later remark that by winning two consecutive Oscars, "nothing worse could have happened to me," as audience expectations from then on would be too high to fulfill. She was then given parts in a string of unimportant movies, leading MGM and Rainer to become disappointed, and she ended her brief three-year career in films, soon returning to Europe. Adding to her rapid decline, some feel, was the "poor career advice" given her by then husband, playwright Clifford Odets, along with the unexpected death, at age 37, of her producer, Irving Thalberg, whom she greatly admired. Some film historians consider her the "most extreme case of an Oscar victim in Hollywood mythology". She currently lives in London.

Wendell Niles (December 29, 1904 – March 28, 1994) was one of the great announcers of the American golden age of radio. He was an announcer on such shows as The Charlotte Greenwood Show, Hedda Hopper''s Hollywood, The Adventures of Philip Marlowe,[2] The Man Called X,[3] The Bob Hope Show, The Burns & Allen Show, The Milton Berle Show and The Chase and Sanborn Hour . On February 15, 1950, Wendell starred in the radio pilot for The Adventures of the Scarlet Cloak along with Gerald Mohr.

He began in entertainment by touring in the 1920s with his own orchestra, playing with the Dorsey Brothers and Bix Beiderbecke.

Niles moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1935 to join George Burns and Gracie Allen.

He and his brother, Ken, developed one of the first radio dramas, which eventually became Theatre of the Mind.

-Los Angeles Magazine- How the intersection got its claim to fame

Q: Why is the intersection of Hollywood and Vine famous? There’s nothing there.

A: In May 1936, Wendell Niles from radio station KFWB brought a microphone to the corner and started a man-on-the-street program. “Niles was a big announcer on radio shows for Bob Hope and George Burns,” says L.A. vocal legend Gary Owens. Niles’s popularization of the corner as shorthand for Hollywood was copied by newspaper reporters and gossip columnists alike and even led to the (terrible) feature film Hollywood and Vine, which was released in 1945. The radio show is gone, but you can still watch celebrities through the glass at the online entertainment network BiteSize TV, whose studios are located in the W Hotel.

He toured with Bob Hope during World War II and narrated a 1936 Academy Award-winning short film on the life of tennis great Bill Tilden.

Among his film credits is Knute Rockne, All American with Ronald Reagan.

Wendell Niles was the announcer for "America''s Show Of Surprises"..."It Could Be You", and the Hatos-Hall production "Your First Impression". Niles was also the original announcer for Let''s Make a Deal during that show''s first season in 1963 and 1964; he was later replaced by Jay Stewart.

Wendell and his brother Ken Niles are the first brothers to have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

His alleged high-profile computer intrusions have been the subject of hundreds of news articles, television segments, and book citations.

Spurred into an award-winning career in journalism and a reconsideration of his hacking ways by a 2003 arrest, Lamo has worked and collaborated with publications ranging from techcentric 2600 Magazine, Network World, and Mobile Magazine, to more egalitarian publications like The American River Current and XY Magazine.

Lamo has also been a regular guest and creative consultant on TechTV''s The Screen Savers, and his life is explored in an upcoming documentary film under the care of Kevin Spacey''s independent film outfit, TriggerStreet.

His intrusions historically carried a twist -- Lamo was never detected by the companies he compromised, instead electing to help them secure their systems free of charge, and then, with prior notice, air their misfortunes to the public. Critics have derided Lamo as publicity-motivated and have ascribed him a variety of ulterior motives, charges which he has consistently declined to respond to.

Lamo has publicly stated that his criminal career is behind him, but his work in journalism has left him no fewer opportunities for adventure -- his interviews have run the gamut from John Ashcroft to the eco-terrorist Earth Liberation Front.

Lamo has cut contact with the press since 2004, living a private life in far Northern California, with his elderly cat as a sidekick.', 'Boston, Massachusetts, USA', 1, '/rqjqa5Ny7ORTH0cvJBYO0c5SZWQ.jpg'),

Robert William Young (born 16 March 1933) is a British television and film director.

Young was born in Cheltenham, and in the 1980s and early 1990s, established himself as a leading director of British TV drama. In the 1970s, he directed Vampire Circus (1972) and Hammer House of Horror. He directed several episodes of Minder and Bergerac in the early 1980s, and the acclaimed TV serial The Mad Death which centred around a rabies outbreak. Perhaps his best remembered television work was on Robin of Sherwood, for which he directed many of the best-regarded episodes.

Young moved towards black comedy in the early 1990s, directing Jeeves and Wooster based on the stories written by P.G. Wodehouse, and GBH, for which he was nominated for a BATA award. It was partly on the strength of GBH that he was assigned to direct Fierce Creatures, John Cleese''s 1997 follow-up to A Fish Called Wanda, which featured many of the same cast as GBH. However, the production ran into problems and Fred Schepisi was brought in to finalise the movie. Young did, however, direct Splitting Heirs, which starred Cleese and Eric Idle.

Young has continued to work on television drama since then.

However that didn''t stop him from starting his martial arts training at age 14 and eventually achieving black belts in tae kwon do & several other arts, and winning numerous US martial arts tournaments.

Blanks first popped up on movie screens in the mid 1980s in tough guy parts utilizing his athletic background and grim faced looks. Films roles included Tango & Cash (1989), Driving Force (1989) and A.W.O.L.: Absent Without Leave (1990). Things looked up in 1991, when Blanks scored the minor role of drug addicted running back "Billy Cole" in the explosive The Last Boy Scout (1991)....and further work followed often sharing lead billing in low budget - high action fare such as Talons of the Eagle (1992), TC 2000 (1993) and Expect No Mercy (1995).

In the late 1990s, Billy''s innovative and exciting "Tae Bo" workout routine swept around the world like wildfire, and propelled him into the position of one of the world''s most recognizable and biggest selling fitness trainers. The remarkable Blanks continues to refine and promote his unique "Tae Bo" fitness system, and he operates the Billy Blanks World Training Center in Sherman Oaks, California.

Fred Kohler (April 20, 1888 – October 28, 1938) was an American actor known for his playing heavies.

Fred Kohler was born in Kansas City, Missouri. As a teen, he began to pursue a career in vaudeville, but worked other jobs to support himself. He lost part of his right hand in a mining accident during this time. Eventually he was able to join a touring company, and worked steadily in show business for several years.  America''s budding film industry drew a 20-something Kohler to Hollywood, where he made his start in silent films. His first role was in the 1911 short The Code of Honor, and he had an uncredited role in Cecil B. DeMille''s feature film Joan the Woman (1917), but a steady stream of parts did not begin until The Tiger''s Trail (1919).

Kohler''s stern features earned him a niche playing villains. His role as Bauman in The Iron Horse (1924) is a notable example. With the advent of the talkies, Kohler reprised many of his silent roles in remakes with sound, particularly in Westerns based on novels by Zane Grey.

At the beginning of the sound era, he appeared in the Allan Dwan film Tide of Empire (1929) alongside Renée Adorée and Tom Keene.  Kohler died of a heart attack on October 28, 1938 at age 50. He was buried in an unmarked grave at Inglewood Park Cemetery in South Los Angeles community of Inglewood, California.

Paula Julie Abdul (born June 19, 1962) is an American recording artist, dancer, choreographer, actress and television personality.

In the 1980s, Abdul rose from cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers to highly sought-after choreographer at the height of the music video era before scoring a string of pop music-R&amp;B hits in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Her six number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 tie her for fifth among the female solo performers who have reached #1 there. She won a Grammy for "Best Music Video - Short Form" for "Opposites Attract" and twice won the "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography".

After her initial period of success, she suffered a series of setbacks in her professional and personal life, until she found renewed fame and success in the 2000s as a judge on the television series, American Idol, for eight years, before departing from the show. Abdul had moved on to another television series, CBS''s Live to Dance, which debuted in January 2011. The series has since been canceled. Following her judging role in Live to Dance, Abdul moved to the American version of The X Factor with her former American Idol co-judge Simon Cowell which will premiere in September 2011. She is said to be working on a new album.

The daughter of the captain of detectives of the Los Angeles Police Department, Virginia Lee O''Brien became interested in music and dance at an early age (it didn''t hurt her career chances that her uncle was noted film director Lloyd Bacon). Her big show-business break came in 1939 after she secured a singing role in the L.A. production of the musical/comedy "Meet the People". On opening night, when time came for her solo number, Virginia became so paralyzed with fright that she sang her song with a wide-eyed motionless stare that sent the audience (which thought her performance a gag) into convulsions. Demoralized, Virginia left the stage only to soon find out that she was a sensation.

Signed by MGM in 1940, she deadpanned her way to acclaim and immense popularity with appearances in some of the studio''s most memorable musicals including Thousands Cheer (1943), The Harvey Girls (1946), Till the Clouds Roll By (1946), Ziegfeld Follies (1945), Panama Hattie (1942), Ship Ahoy (1942), Meet the People (1944) and Du Barry Was a Lady (1943), performing inimitable renditions of such classic songs as "The Wild Wild West" (from The Harvey Girls), "A Fine Romance" (from Till the Clouds Roll By (1946)), "It''s a Great Big World" (from The Harvey Girls (1946)), "Poor You" (from Ship Ahoy (1942)), and "Say We''re Sweethearts Again" (from Meet the People (1944)).

Although too often relegated to featured songs and small supporting roles, she still managed to become an audience favorite by the sheer force of her personality, polished vocals and way with a comic quip. The latter ability is especially apparent in one of her last MGM films, Merton of the Movies (1947), in which she co-starred with Red Skelton. In 1948, after 17 memorable screen appearances for MGM, the studio unceremoniously dropped her from its roster. She returned to films only twice more after her termination from MGM, in Universal''s Francis in the Navy (1955) and Disney''s Gus (1976), preferring to focus her energies on television and the stage, where she delighted audiences for three more decades.

In the 1980s the still youthful beauty toured the country in a one-woman show and recorded a live album at the famed Masquers Club entitled, "A Salute to the Great MGM Musicals". One of her last significant stage appearances came in 1984 as Parthy Ann in the Long Beach Civic Light Opera''s production of "Showboat", with Alan Young. She remained in semi-retirement in a large home in Wrightwood, California, for most of her later years until her death at the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Woodland Hills, 16 January, 2001, from a heart attack.', 'Los Angeles, California, U.S.', 1, '/94xpt8NAx2qVaTeNtPmYVtm5szh.jpg'),

He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that''s what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others.

After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother''s collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play "Dylan''s Ghost" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature Glorious Mail(2005).

Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he''s almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he''s come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director''s second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way''s New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist''s print worth $80.

In 1933, he directed, with Joris Ivens, Misère au Borinage, a film about the miners in the Borinage area. In 1938, with Andre Thirifays and Pierre Vermeylen, he founded the Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique (Royal Belgian Film Archive). He was an actor in two key films of the history of the cinema: Jean Vigo''s Zéro de conduite (1933) in the role of the priest, and Chantal Akerman''s Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quay Commercial, 1080 Brussels (1976) in the role of a customer of the prostitute.

Jacqueline Aubenas wrote about him, in her expository work, It''s been going on for 100 years: a history of the francophone cinema of Belgium: "There emerges forcefully the personality of a cineaste who is not a militant in the sense that this term had in the 1930s for Soviet directors who held an ideology, but in the sense of a generous man who will never choose the wrong side and who will be, in ethics as well as in esthetics, in the first line of battle".

The dramatic performances earned the actress 6 nominations and huge critical acclaim for her emotional portrayal as the vulnerable Jo. Pallett decided to leave the show in 2009 to "earn her stripes and discover new characters" and after starring in ITV''s ''Dancing On Ice'' Season 4, wowing audiences with her impressive daredevil moves such as the ''head banger'', Pallett then treaded the boards in three lead consecutive theatre roles, 1950''s musical ''Rock Around The Clock'', Eve Ensler''s UK tour ''The Vagina Monologues'' and two-hander play "Satin ''n'' Steel", winning as much credibility and popularity on stage as she did previously on screen. She then silenced her critics by playing 17 year old troubled school girl Shelby Dixon in BBC''s Waterloo Road, a role that was ten years younger than the actress herself in real life. 2012 was a huge year for Pallett when she was cast as the lead role of Sarah McColl in British film ''Devil''s Tower'' when she originally walked in to audition for a smaller part as the friend. After shooting the intense horror film, Pallett then began filming an Urban Comedy for Kaleidoscope Pictures, ''It''s A Lot'' playing the quirky college misfit Louise. In 2013 Pallett beat a whole host of musical theatre talent to the lead role of Janet Weiss in the 40th anniversary UK tour of ''The Rocky Horror Show'' which saw her transform yet again, this time into a 1950''s blonde All-American sweetheart. Pallett then went straight into her next stage role as Shelley for The Royal Court''s in ''Ladies Day''. The play proved to be her biggest on stage challenge to date, due to the role being ''scouse'' and her being the only non Liverpudlian actor in the cast. She won rave reviews for her comedic timing and flawless ''scouse'' accent.

He started in variety at the Kilburn Empire in 1946, and his stage appearances included The Sunshine Boys and Fiddler On The Roof. He was also involved in comedy work with Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe which later led to the formation (along with writer Spike Milligan) of The Goon Show, though Marks himself was not to become a member of that comedy group.

His films included The Frightened City and Scream and Scream Again. His television show, Alfred Marks Time, ran for 6 years on ITV. He compered Sunday Night at the London Palladium and appeared in numerous other television programmes including Albert and Victoria, The Good Old Days, Blankety Blank, The Marti Caine Show, The Two Ronnies, The Generation Game, Lovejoy, Minder (TV series), Parkinson, The All New Alexei Sayle Show and the Dramarama play The Comeuppance of Captain Katt (a satire on the current state of Doctor Who).

In 1967 Marks toured Australia for JC Williamson Theatres in Bill Naughton''s Spring & Port Wine. In 1968 he played the lead in The Young Visiters a musical version of the turn of the 20th century Daisy Ashford novel, written when she was six and published as submitted by her with the spelling error, at the Vaudeville Theatre in London.

Marks also appeared in the role of Wilfred Shadbolt in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Yeomen of the Guard in 1982.

While on tour in Australia, Marks was appointed the second King of Moomba (1968) by the Melbourne Moomba festival committee; when asked what his qualifications were, he quipped (in full Cockney):

    "When I was eleven there were rival gangs around a fruit market in the East End. And desperately, I always wanted to be a member of the bigger rival gang. One day when I was in my best Easter suit, someone from one of the other gangs said to me ''would you like to be King of the Golden Apples?'' ''All right, just sit there on this box and call out Apples, Apples, give me the Golden Apples.'' Which innocently I did and they cobbled me with every rotten apple in the market."

William Lawrence Boyd (June 5, 1895 – September 12, 1972) was an American film actor who is best known for portraying the cowboy hero Hopalong Cassidy.  Boyd was born in Hendrysburg, Ohio, and reared in Cambridge, Ohio and Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was the son of a day laborer, Charles William Boyd, and his wife, the former Lida Wilkens (aka Lyda). Following his father''s death, he moved to California and worked as an orange picker, surveyor, tool dresser and auto salesman.

In Hollywood, he found work as an extra in Why Change Your Wife? and other films. During World War I, he enlisted in the army but was exempt from military service because of a "weak heart". More prominent film roles followed, including his breakout role as Jack Moreland in Cecil B. DeMille''s The Road to Yesterday (1925) which starred also Joseph Schildkraut, Jetta Goudal, and Vera Reynolds. Boyd''s performance in the film was praised by critics, while movie-goers were equally impressed by his easy charm, charisma, and intense good-looks. Due to Boyd''s growing popularity, DeMille soon cast him as the leading man in the highly acclaimed silent drama film, The Volga Boatman. Boyd''s role as Feodor blew critics away, and with Boyd now firmly established as a matinee idol and romantic leading man, he began earning an annual salary of $100,000. He acted in DeMille''s extravaganza The King of Kings (in which he played Simon of Cyrene, helping Jesus carry the cross) and DeMille''s Skyscraper (1928). He then appeared in D.W. Griffith''s Lady of the Pavements (1929).

Radio Pictures ended Boyd''s contract in 1931 when his picture was mistakenly run in a newspaper story about the arrest of another actor, William "Stage" Boyd, on gambling and liquor charges. Although the newspaper apologized, explaining the mistake in the following day''s newspaper, Boyd said, "The damage was already done." William "Stage" Boyd died in 1935, the same year William L. Boyd became Hopalong Cassidy, the role that led to his enduring fame. But at the time in 1931, Boyd was virtually broke and without a job, and for a few years he was credited in films as "Bill Boyd" to prevent being mistaken for the other William Boyd.', 'Hendrysburg, Ohio, USA', 1, '/hASlEm6UEICi8HI5oeLZwkzI4ad.jpg'),

Bill Oberst Jr. is an American actor known for his disturbing onscreen presence, often playing dark and conflicted characters on film and television. 

Oberst is a veteran stage actor who came to Hollywood in 2008 and quickly began to be cast in horror and thriller films. Notable exceptions were the 2011 Hallmark Channel TV-movie THE SHUNNING and its 2012 sequel THE CONFESSION (in which director Michael Landon Jr. cast Oberst in the film''s male lead role of an Amish farmer) and an award-winning turn as General William Tecumseh Sherman in the History Channel''s docudrama SHERMAN''S MARCH. Oberst has also toured theatrically in a first-person stage recreation of the teachings of Jesus Of Nazareth and in a string of one-man shows whose subjects included President John F. Kennedy, Mark Twain and humorist Lewis Grizzard. He remains best known as a horror genre actor, however.

Bill Oberst Jr.''s trademark piercing star and rough-hewn face have led him to be cast as monsters, murderers, vampires and cannibals, often in minimal wardrobe. His oddly shaped torso and partially-exposed ribcage are almost as recognizable to genre fans as his face. Oberst is often quoted as saying that he believes the human body''s capacity to disturb on film is just as strong as its capacity to entice. In 2011, Oberst was seen by over 60 million internet viewers worldwide as the cyber stalker in the Facebook application TAKE THIS LOLLIPOP, (http://www.takethislollipop.com) which broke records to become the fastest-growing application in Facebook history and the most popular horror-themed application in internet history. 

In person, his quiet demeanor and interest in things spiritual seem sharply at odds with the roles he plays. A native Southerner, Oberst is a fulltime actor living in Los Angeles.

Mr. Brainwash ("MBW") is a pseudonym for Thierry Guetta in the film Exit Through the Gift Shop, directed by Banksy. Guetta is presented in the 2010 film as a French citizen who now lives in Los Angeles, having been a proprietor of a clothing store and videographer who evolved into a street artist and gallery artist, influenced by the street artists he documented through video over the years. According to the film, Guetta was first introduced to street art by his cousin, the French street artist, Invader. The film includes authentic documentation of Space Invader, Shepard Fairey, Banksy and other well-known street artists at work on the streets, and is directed by Banksy with significant participation from Fairey.

The artwork attributed to Guetta strongly emulates the styles and artistic concepts of well-known street artists including Banksy and Shepard Fairey. Like Banksy, Guetta employs famous artistic and historic images, many of which are copyrighted, and amends the originals in slight or significant ways. Unlike Banksy, who is shown in the film creating his own work, Guetta states in the film that his work largely consists of "scanning and photoshopping," acts which are carried out by hired assistants. Guetta further admits in Exit Through The Gift Shop that most of the actual artistic process is carried out by hired graphic designers to whom he describes his ideas. In the film, he is not shown creating much artwork himself.

Guetta''s first show Life is Beautiful opened in Los Angeles June 18, 2008. In 2009, Guetta created the cover art for Madonna''s Celebration album. On February 14, 2010, his second show ICONS opened in New York City.

La trasmissione televisiva che li consacrò al successo popolare fu Non stop diretta da Enzo Trapani, nella quale i Giancattivi si esibivano a fianco del trio napoletano de La Smorfia, di Massimo Troisi Lello Arena Enzo Decaro, Zuzzurro e Gaspare e di molti altri giovani comici che avrebbero calcato le scene cinematografiche, teatrali e televisive negli anni successivi.  L''esordio al cinema avvenne nel 1982 sotto la direzione di Alessandro Benvenuti in Ad ovest di Paperino, un film in cui Athina Cenci, assieme ai due compagni di sempre, dava libero sfogo alla sua comicità surreale, intervallata a momenti di una pur blanda analisi sociale.  Le sue due prove cinematografiche più mature sono state però senz''altro in Speriamo che sia femmina (1986), per la regia di Mario Monicelli e Compagni di scuola (1988) di Carlo Verdone. L''interpretazione di queste pellicole le è valsa, in entrambi i casi, l''assegnazione del David di Donatello quale miglior attrice non protagonista.  L''attività cinematografica (e televisiva) della Cenci è proseguita, pur se con alterne fortune, anche negli anni Novanta (Benvenuti in casa Gori, Ritorno a casa Gori e I miei più cari amici sempre di Alessandro Benvenuti e le serie TV Il coraggio di Anna e Il mastino, solo per ricordare le interpretazioni principali).  La sua profonda capacità di mescolare i toni comici a quelli drammatici, la sua vena surreale sempre presente nei dialoghi e la sua chiara sensibilità a conformarsi ai dettati della regia, hanno fatto e fanno di Athina Cenci una delle migliori attrici che il cinema italiano contemporaneo abbia conosciuto.  Nel 1999 è entrata a far parte del consiglio comunale di Firenze dopo le elezioni del 13 giugno, nelle file dei Democratici di Sinistra. Degna di nota anche la sua presenza sulle scene teatrali. Un discreto successo ha ottenuto la pièce teatrale La donna gigante di Lidia Ravera.

Nicknamed “il principe della risata’ ("the prince of laughter"), he was an Italian comedian, film and theatre actor, writer, singer and songwriter, and widely considered one of the greatest Italian artists of the 20th century.  While he first gained his popularity as a comic actor, his dramatic roles, poetry, and songs are all of cultural import; his style and a number of his recurring jokes and gestures have become universally known memes in Italy.

As a comic actor, Totò is classified as an heir of the Commedia dell''Arte tradition, and has been compared to such figures as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.  At the age of 15, he was already acting as a comedian in small theatres, under pseudonym "Clerment". His early repertoire mostly consisted in imitations of Gustavo De Marco''s characters.  He served in the army during World War I and then went back to acting to develop the trademarks of his style.   

In 1937, he appeared in his first movie "Fermo con le mani", and later starred in other 96 films, many of which are still frequently broadcast on Italian television.In his vast cinematographic career, Totò had the opportunity to act side by side with virtually all major Italian actors of the time. Totò''s unmistakable figure, with his peculiarly irregular face (due to an accident in his teen years), and his unique trademark ability to disarticulate his body like a marionette, soon became very popular and his comic gags became part of the Italian culture. Totò died at the age of 69 in Rome, after a series of heart attacks. Due to overwhelming popular request there were three funeral services: the first in Rome, and the second and third in Naples.

She is the daughter of James Donlan, who was a hard working character actor in Hollywood films of the 1930s. It is thought that she had some uncredited roles in films including Pennies From Heaven and Love Finds Andy Hardy immediately following her father''s death in 1938, but these have not been confirmed.

Her early credited roles include Frenchy the maid in the horror film The Devil Bat in 1940 and she followed this up with several small roles, generally as similar French-accented maid characters.

A notable stage success as Billie Dawn in a Boston production of Born Yesterday by Garson Kanin was the start of bigger things for Donlan. The production transferred to London''s West End for a long run. Donlan was initially denied a work permit to star in the lead in Peter Pan due to complaints from Actors Equity who felt that a British star should have the lead.

After it ended, Donlan remained in the United Kingdom and began accepting film work. After Traveller''s Joy in 1949, Donlan worked for the director Val Guest in several films including Mister Drake''s Duck, Penny Princess (in the title role) and The Body Said No.

Donlan married Guest in 1954 and afterwards her film work included many of her husband''s films such as Expresso Bongo and 80,000 Suspects, as well as a small number of films for other directors. In 1955 she penned the autobiographical travelogue, Sand in my Mink an amusing tale of adventures taken with her husband, across Europe, which makes a light hearted read of how travel used to be.

A further stage success came in 1959 in Jack Popplewell''s And Suddenly It''s Spring opposite Margaret Lockwood.

Her most recent film credit is Seven Nights in Japan from 1976. The same year saw publication of her autobiography, Shake the Stars Down, which concentrates on her childhood years growing up in the Hollywood of the 1930s.

William Austin  (12 June 1884 – 15 June 1975) was a British character actor who was born on a sugar plantation in Georgetown in British Guiana (now Guyana). On the death of his father he was brought to England to complete his education. He later filled a business post in Shanghai and on being sent to San Francisco by the company he worked for, he decided to stay in America and take up acting on the stage and later in films. He appeared in many American films and serials between the 1920s and the 1940s, though the vast majority of his roles were small and uncredited. He was the brother of actor Albert Austin. He died in Newport Beach, California.

Of the numerous silent films Austin appeared in, he is best remembered as the sidekick friend of Clara Bow in Bow''s best known film It (1927).

Mr. Austin''s portrayal in the 1943 Batman serial of Batman''s butler Alfred is the iconic portrayal still used in the comics. Previous to being played by Mr. Austin, the character was fat and had no facial hair. Performed by Mr. Austin, the character was thin with a mustache. Shortly after the serial was released, Alfred in the comics was changed to match the look of the serial; this representation of the character has for the most part continued to this day except for the live action films, the Birds of Prey series, and the Deadshot short in Batman: Gotham Knight where he has no moustache.

Abraham Sofaer (October 1, 1896 – January 21, 1988) was a stage actor of Burmese-Jewish descent who became a familiar supporting player on film and television in his later years. He was born in Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar). Sofaer''s strong features and resonant voice complemented the many exotic character parts he played. He began his acting career on the London stage in 1921, but soon was alternating between London and Broadway. By the 1930s, he was appearing in both British and American films. Among his more prominent performances were the dual role of the Judge and Surgeon in Powell and Pressburger''s A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and St. Paul in Quo Vadis (1951). He also appeared on television from its earliest days in the late 1930s and on radio. Although his film appearances diminished after the 1950s, he continued to have guest roles on dozens of major U.S. television series throughout the 1960s, including Star Trek ("Charlie X"), The Twilight Zone ("The Mighty Casey"), Lost in Space ("The Flaming Planet") and The Outer Limits ("Demon with a Glass Hand"), until retiring in the mid 1970s. He may be best-remembered for his recurring role as Hadji, the master of all genies, on I Dream of Jeannie. Sofaer married Psyche Angela Christian, with whom he had two sons and four daughters. He died in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, as the result of congestive heart failure in 1988. The noted jurist of the same name is the son of one of the actor''s cousins.

Best known for his role as Mike "Bayleaf" Wilson in the ITV drama, London''s Burning (1988), many real-life firefighters thought Bayleaf was the character who closely and accurately portrayed your average real-life firefighter, a credit to his acting abilities. A meticulous performer, he was well-known for researching every part he played, and firmly believed that by accurately portraying a character the audience would feel much more involved in and enveloped by the performance. He played the role continuously for seven years from the serial''s inception in 1988. (The character''s sobriquet stemmed from a culinary bent for complex recipes).

In a career spanning three decades, he also guested in such series as ''Boon'' and ''Miss Marple'', and, in the late 1980s, played the manager of the electrics company in Central''s early-evening situation comedy, Young, Gifted and Broke (1989). In 1995, Hazeldine''s character was written out of London''s Burning of the actor''s own volition, but he remained with the programme as a director. In years to come, he expanded his directing talents to encompass other UK drama serials, among them TV''s The Knock (1994) and Heartbeat (1992). His acting CV also included sporadic film appearances, such as Pink Floyd: The Wall (1982). Although renowned as a television performer, he was also a respected stage actor, having trained with the Royal Shakespeare Company and, at one time, acted on Broadway alongside Glenda Jackson. He was rehearsing for his role as Sigmund Freud in a new stage play, ''The Talking Cure'', when he became ill. In 2002 he appeared in the controversial drama, Shipman, which re-enacted events surrounding the murderous killing spree of Dr Harold Shipman, Britain''s most prolific serial killer. Hazeldine assumed the role of Detective Inspector Stan Egerton, the man charged with leading the investigation into the deranged doctor''s crimes.

Determined that the dramatization should be as authentic as possible, Hazeldine even met with the retired policeman to ensure a realistic portrayal of the diligent law enforcer. Ironically, while the Shipman drama was in production, the real-life Mr. Egerton died suddenly and prematurely of a coronary disorder. James Hazeldine died on 18 December 2002, aged 55.

Clem Bevans (October 16, 1879 – August 11, 1963) was an American character actor best remembered for playing eccentric, grumpy old men.

Bevans had a very long career, starting in vaudeville in 1900 in an act with Grace Emmett. He progressed to burlesque, Broadway, and even light opera, before making his film debut at the age of 55 in Way Down East (1935). His portrayal was so good, he became stereotyped and played mostly likable old codgers for the rest of his life. Bevans played the neighbour of Gregory Peck in The Yearling and the gatekeeper in Harvey (1950). However, he did occasionally play against type, for example as a Nazi spy in Alfred Hitchcock''s Saboteur (1942). He also made some television appearances, including the role of murderer Captain Hugo in the 1958 Perry Mason episode "The Case of the Demure Defendant" and as Pete in The Twilight Zone episode "Hocus-Pocus and Frisby" (1962). He played Captain Cobb in Disney''s TV miniseries Davy Crockett.

Charlie Hall (19 August 1899 – 7 December 1959) was an English film actor. He is best known as the "Little Nemesis" of Laurel and Hardy and appeared in nearly 50 films with them, so that Hall was the most frequent supporting actor of their films.

Hall was born in Ward End, Birmingham, Warwickshire, and learned carpentry as a trade, but as a teenager, he became a member of the Fred Karno troupe of stage comedians. In his late teens, he visited his sister in New York and stayed there, finding employment as a stagehand. While working behind the scenes, he met the comic actor Bobby Dunn and they became friends; Dunn convinced Hall to take a stab again at acting, which he did. By the mid-1920s, Hall was working for Hal Roach. Stan Laurel, one of Roach''s comedy stars, was also a graduate of the Karno troupe.

As an actor, Hall worked with such comedians as Buster Keaton and Charley Chase, but is best remembered as a comic foil for Laurel and Hardy. He appeared in nearly 50 of their films, sometimes in bit parts, but often as a mean landlord or opponent in many of their memorable tit-for-tat sequences. Unlike the usual villains in Laurel and Hardy films, who were big and burly, Charlie Hall (billed as "Charley" Hall in the Roach comedies) was of short stature, standing 5 ft 5 in tall. His height and slight English accent allowed him to be convincingly cast as a college student, despite being 40 years old, in Laurel and Hardy''s A Chump at Oxford.

Hall almost never played starring roles; the exception was in 1941, when he was teamed with character comedian Frank Faylen by Monogram Pictures. Hall continued to play bits and supporting roles in short subjects and features through the 1940s and 1950s, occasionally on TV, appearing very briefly in Charlie Chaplin''s final American film, Limelight (1952).

In 1956 he played a small but important part in the TV show Cheyenne, season 1, episode 11, "Quicksand", starring Clint Walker, with Dennis Hopper, John Alderson, Wright King and Peggy Webber. His last role was in a Joe McDoakes short film starring George O''Hanlon, So You Want to Play the Piano, in 1956.

Hall died in North Hollywood, California, on 7 December 1959. A J D Wetherspoon''s public house in Erdington, is named The Charlie Hall as a tribute to him.', 'Birmingham, England, UK', 1, '/vttfiluEvKP7hZIcSCmrLqK07jj.jpg'),

After failing singing auditions for the bands of Benny Goodman and both Jimmy Dorsey and his brother Tommy Dorsey, Shore struck out on her own to become the first singer of her era to achieve huge solo success. She had a string of 80 charted popular hits, lasting from 1940 into the late ''50s, and after appearing in a handful of films went on to a four-decade career in American television, starring in her own music and variety shows in the ''50s and ''60s and hosting two talk shows in the ''70s. TV Guide magazine ranked her at #16 on their list of the top fifty television stars of all time. Stylistically, Dinah Shore was compared to two singers who followed her in the mid-to-late ''40s and early ''50s, Doris Day and Patti Page.

Already as a teenager he had begun to perform as a vocalist and drummer with a local band headed by Don Ramon Cruz. In the early forties he Anglicized his name (Andy was obvious, but "Russell" was after the singer Russ Columbo). He became vocalist and drummer with the bands of Johnny Richards, Gus Arnheim, Sonny Dunham, and Alvino Rey. By 1944, he had become well enough regarded a pop vocalist to be featured on radio, and in the next year had his Old Gold Show. He also signed on with Capitol Records. His first charted hit was "Bésame Mucho" (Capitol #149, 1944). The same year he had his biggest hit, which became his signature tune, "Amor" (Capitol #156, with the flip side "The Day After Forever") from the film "Broadway Rhythm". He had two more hits that year: "What a Difference a Day Made" (Capitol #167, paired with "Don''t You Notice Anything New ") and "I Dream of You"/"Magic Is Moonlight" (Capitol #175). He had another big hit in 1946 with "I Can''t Begin to Tell You" (Capitol #221) from the film "The Dolly Sisters." This became the fourth top ten seller in the country for Russell in less than two years and the big time was calling. The next big hit came later in 1946: a two-sided hit with "Laughing on the Outside" and "They Say It''s Wonderful" (from the Broadway show Annie Get Your Gun) (Capitol #252). His next hit was "Pretending" (Capitol #271, backed with "Who Do You Love") was another top-ten seller. He was also invited to Hollywood and screen tested for motion pictures. In 1946 he appeared in The Stork Club and Breakfast In Hollywood. He was on the soundtrack of Walt Disney''s Make Mine Music, and appeared in the picture Copacabana the next year. In 1946, the people running the pop music radio program Your Hit Parade asked him to take the place of Frank Sinatra (Sinatra returned in 1947). This led to increased popularity for the singer.

He died in Sun City, Arizona. He was buried in the Loma Vista Memorial Park in Fullerton, California.

Documentarian Frederick Wiseman has been noted for his ability to capture the nuances of life in American institutions such as prisons, hospitals, welfare offices, and high schools. He started out in 1963 by producing a fictional feature film, The Cool World, an examination of the lives of Harlem teenagers. In the beginning, Wiseman was a staunch social reformist, and his films were calls for change. Titicut Follies, his first documentary, is an exposé of life in a prison for the criminally insane in Bridgewater, MA. It was controversial and left Wiseman with the reputation of being a muckraker. His four subsequent documentaries were all exposés of other tax-supported institutions designed to show the ineffectiveness of the bureaucracy that not only threatens to destroy them, but also dehumanizes the people they were meant to serve. Wiseman toned down his message and began focusing more on American culture to point out the symbolism of daily activities in his film Primate (1974). In the ‘80s, he began examining institutions as they relate to ideology. Unlike other documentaries, Wiseman’s work does not progress chronologically; rather, the segments are arranged thematically, like an essay, and are linked via rhetorical devices such as comparison and contrast to create a patterned structure. His films are never narrated, thereby forcing viewers to make connections between the sequences themselves. Wiseman has occasionally returned to fictional films, albeit in a non-fiction performance style, as with Seraphita’s Diary (1982) and La Derniere Lettre (2002).', 'Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.', 1, '/uYlxuYtXn27b4CYLII2K8KyqwUc.jpg'),

Tony Bennett (born Anthony Dominick Benedetto; August 3, 1926) is an American singer of popular music, standards, show tunes, and jazz.

Raised in New York City, Bennett began singing at an early age. He fought in the final stages of World War II as an infantryman with the U.S. Army in the European Theatre. Afterwards, he developed his singing technique, signed with Columbia Records, and had his first number one popular song with "Because of You" in 1951. Several top hits such as "Rags to Riches" followed in the early 1950s. Bennett then further refined his approach to encompass jazz singing. He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as The Beat of My Heart and Basie Swings, Bennett Sings. In 1962, Bennett recorded his signature song, "I Left My Heart in San Francisco". His career and his personal life then suffered an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era.

Bennett staged a remarkable comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s, putting out gold record albums again and expanding his audience to the MTV Generation while keeping his musical style intact. He remains a popular and critically praised recording artist and concert performer in the 2000s. Bennett has won fifteen Grammy Awards, two Emmy Awards, been named an NEA Jazz Master and a Kennedy Center Honoree. He has sold over 50 million records worldwide. Bennett is also a serious and accomplished painter, creating works under the name Benedetto that are on permanent public display in several institutions. He is also the founder of Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens.', 'Astoria, Queens, New York City, New York, USA', 1, '/8mFowqqjo5XGHjiVUKZi6Sepbbh.jpg'),

After thirteen films in that capacity, he was assigned to the story department writing cartoon short continuities, beginning withDonald''s Nephews (released on April 15, 1938). He received writing credit on 21 Disney cartoon shorts.In 1942 he collaborated with Carl Barks on the first two comic books Barks worked on, Pluto Saves the Ship and Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold. Hannah in subsequent years did a handful of other Donald Duck comic book stories but unlike Barks he stayed at the studio and eventually was given a chance to be a director. The short Donald''s Off Day (released on December 8, 1944) was the first of 94 films he would direct. These include most of the shorts featuring Donald Duck in the post-war era along with all starring Chip ''n Dale and Humphrey the Bear; he also directed some shorts starring Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Pluto and some minor Walt Disney characters. After Disney stopped producing animated shorts Hannah did 14 episodes of the Walt Disney anthology television series (composed of footage from the classic cartoons along with new linking material) and fulfilled his ambition to direct live-action by handling Walt Disney''s introductions for the episodes. Hannah hoped to segue into a career in live-action but "Walt had me pegged as an animation director so he balked at the suggestion. We had a few heated discussions and I became aware that I had come to an impasse." He then went to the Walter Lantz Studio and directed a number of films featuring Woody Woodpecker and some minor characters. Besides directing shorts Hannah also was Assistant Director for the TV series The Woody Woodpecker Show, which started airing on October 3, 1957. "I did more or less the same thing that I did with Walt Disney in directing live action except Lantz was better at taking direction." His last directing effort was the short Charlie''s Mother-In-Law (released on April 16, 1963). He retired shortly thereafter.Hannah was one of the co-founders, along with T. Hee, of the Character Animation program at the California Institute of the Arts.Hannah was honored as a "Disney Legend" in 1992.

Elizabeth Mary Furness (January 3, 1916 – April 2, 1994) was an American actress, consumer advocate, and current affairs commentator.  She began her professional career as a model before being noticed by a talent scout and being signed to a film contract in 1932 by RKO Studios. Her first film role was as the "Thirteenth Woman" in the film Thirteen Women (1932) but her scenes were deleted before the film''s release.

Over the next few years, she appeared in several RKO films, and became a popular actress. Among her film successes were Magnificent Obsession (1935) and the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film Swing Time (1936). By the end of the decade, she had appeared in over forty films, but during the 1940s, she found it difficult to secure acting roles.  In 1948, Furness was performing in the television series Studio One, which was broadcast live.

By age 49 his stage act had become so popular that he felt compelled to write, with the help of two newspaper writers, a 3000-word collection of his monologues (at the urging of his lawyer who expressed dismay over lesser comedians stealing his act), which was published as "The Specialist". The book was a huge hit, published in nine languages, and remains in print  to this day. (Sale took six months off touring to personally answer fan mail resulting from the book. A sequel was published as "I''ll Tell You Why".) During the 1930s and ''40s there were outhouses sporting "Chic Sale" signs all over the world, his name becoming synonymous for toilet (which didn''t please him in the least) and the butt of fellow comedian Groucho Marx''s jokes.

After appearing in a flop Broadway show in 1930, Sale headed for Hollywood for good and became, thanks to effective makeup and complete mastery of his lanky body, a character actor. Still in his mid to late 40s, he convincingly played octogenarians. He did this so well that it was quite a shock to see him out of make-up; he was unrecognizable from his old man screen persona.

Chic Sale died of pneumonia in 1936 at just 51 years of age. He was survived by his wife Marie.', 'Huron, South Dakota, USA', 1, '/rpScTj8rsHIKyMyK0wCVRHLth8X.jpg'),

Her break-out role was as Valli Wooley in the 2009 film I Love You, Beth Cooper directed by Chris Columbus. Since then, she has appeared in more film and TV roles: as Kirstie in Cult, as Kim Rhodes in Hunt to Kill, and the sci-fi series The 100 as Octavia Blake.

Career

After studying broadcast journalism for two years in her hometown, Avgeropoulos moved to Europe. Several months later, she came back to Canada and settled in Vancouver. Avgeropoulos started playing drums when she was 16. One of her friends invited her for a casting call in Vancouver, which happened to be looking for drummers. A talent agent recognized her talent and invited her to appear in various national commercials. She caught the attention of director Chris Columbus. He hired Avgeropoulos for I Love You, Beth Cooper, which became her first feature film role. Her appearance in the film gave her the opportunities to star in more films and television shows.

In 2010, Avgeropoulos was cast as Kim Rhodes in the film Hunt to Kill, which became her break-out role.

Early in 2013, Avgeropoulos made her break-out in television after being cast for a recurring role in The CW''s Cult.

However, the series failed to attract viewers and after episode 7, the show was canceled. The remaining six episodes of the show were broadcast later in the summer.

Not long after the show ended, The CW cast her as one of the main characters in their new sci-fi, The 100, to portray the character Octavia Blake.', 'Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada', 4, '/jhmf0biqz0ulU0Plupro0jS6kUY.jpg'),

Edison "Edson" Arantes do Nascimento   KBE (born 21 or 23 October 1940 ), best known by his nickname Pelé is a retired Brazilian footballer. He is widely regarded among football historians, former players and fans to be one of the greatest football players of all time.  In 1999, he was voted as the Football Player of the Century by the IFFHS International Federation of Football History and Statistics. In the same year French weekly magazine France-Football consulted their former "Ballon D''Or" winners to elect the Football Player of the Century. Pelé came in first position. In 1999 the International Olympic Committee named Pelé the "Athlete of the Century". In his career he scored 760 official goals, 541 in league championships, making him the top scorer of all time. In total Pelé scored 1281 goals in 1363 games. In his native Brazil, Pelé is hailed as a national hero. He is known for his accomplishments and contributions to the game of football.[19] He is also acknowledged for his vocal support of policies to improve the social conditions of the poor (when he scored his 1,000th goal he dedicated it to the poor children of Brazil). During his career, he became known as "The King of Football" (O Rei do Futebol), "The King Pelé" (O Rei Pelé) or simply "The King" (O Rei). Spotted by football star Waldemar de Brito, Pelé began playing for Santos at 15 and his national team at 16, and won his first World Cup at 17. Despite numerous offers from European clubs, the economic conditions and Brazilian football regulations at the time benefited Santos, thus enabling them to keep Pelé for almost two decades until 1974. With Pelé within their ranks, Santos reach their zenith by winning the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club competition in South American football.Pelé played as an inside second forward, also known as a playmaker. Pelé''s technique and natural athleticism have been universally praised and during his playing years he was renowned for his excellent dribbling and passing, his pace, powerful shot, exceptional heading ability, and prolific goalscoring. He is the all-time leading scorer of the Brazil national football team and is the only footballer to be a part of three World Cup-winning squads. In 1962 he was on the Brazilian squad at the start of the World Cup but because of an injury suffered in the second match, he was not able to play the remainder of the tournament. In November 2007 FIFA announced that he would be awarded the 1962 medal retroactively, making him the only player in the world to have three World Cup winning medals. Since his retirement in 1977, Pelé has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has undertaken various acting roles and commercial ventures. He is currently the Honorary President of the New York Cosmos.

He had a string of hits including "Cry to Me", "If You Need Me", "Got to Get You Off My Mind", "Down in the Valley" and "Everybody Needs Somebody to Love". Burke was referred to as "King Solomon", the "King of Rock ''n'' Soul", "Bishop of Soul" and the "Muhammad Ali of soul". Due to Burke''s minimal chart success in comparison to other soul music greats such as James Brown, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding, Burke is often described as the genre''s "most unfairly overlooked singer" of its golden age. Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler once referred to Burke as "the greatest male soul singer of all time".

Burke''s most famous recordings, which spanned five years in the early 1960s, bridged the gap between mainstream R&amp;B and grittier R&amp;B. Burke was "a singer whose smooth, powerful articulation and mingling of sacred and profane themes helped define soul music in the early 1960s." He drew from his roots - gospel, jazz, country and blues - as well as developing his own style at a time when R&amp;B, and rock were both still in their infancy. Described as both "Rabelaisian" and also as a "spiritual enigma," "perhaps more than any other artist, the ample figure of Solomon Burke symbolized the ways that spirituality and commerce, ecstasy and entertainment, sex and salvation, individualism and brotherhood, could blend in the world of 1960s soul music."

During the 55 years that he performed professionally, Burke released 38 studio albums on at least 17 record labels and had 35 singles that charted in the US, including 26 singles that made the Billboard R&amp;B charts. In 2001, Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a performer. His album Don''t Give Up on Me won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003. By 2005 Burke was credited with selling 17 million albums.

Ulu Grosbard (born 9 January 1929) is a Belgian-born, naturalized American theatre and film director and film producer.

Born in Antwerp, Grosbard emigrated to Havana with his family in 1942. In 1948, they moved to the United States, where he earned Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees from the University of Chicago. He studied then at the Yale School of Drama for one year before joining the United States Army, and he became a naturalized citizen in 1954.

Grosbard gravitated towards theatre when he relocated to New York City in the early 1960s. After directing The Days and Nights of BeeBee Fenstermaker off-Broadway, he earned his first Broadway credit with The Subject Was Roses, for which he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play in 1964. That same year he won the Obie Award for Best Direction and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Play for an off-Broadway revival of the Arthur Miller play A View from the Bridge, for which Dustin Hoffman served as stage manager and assistant director.

Grosbard''s additional Broadway credits include Miller''s The Price; David Mamet''s American Buffalo, which earned him Tony and Drama Desk Award nominations; Woody Allen''s The Floating Light Bulb; and a revival of Paddy Chayefsky''s The Tenth Man.

In Hollywood, Grosbard worked as an assistant director on Splendor in the Grass, West Side Story, The Hustler, The Miracle Worker, and The Pawnbroker  before helming the screen adaptation of The Subject Was Roses on his own. Additional screen credits include Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? and Straight Time, both with Dustin Hoffman; True Confessions and Falling in Love, both with Robert De Niro; Georgia for which he won the Grand Prix des Amériques at the Montréal World Film Festival; and The Deep End of the Ocean.

Grosbard has been married to actress Rose Gregorio since 1965.

His father is from Cameroon; his mother is from France. Dieudonné initially achieved success with a Jewish comedian, Élie Semoun, humorously exploiting racial stereotypes. He campaigned against racism and was a candidate in the 1997 and 2001 legislative elections in Dreux against the National Front, the French far-right political party that he perceived as racist. On 1 December 2003, Dieudonné performed a sketch on a TV show about an Israeli settler whom he depicted as a Nazi. Some critics argued that he had "crossed the limits of antisemitism" and several organizations sued him for incitement to racial hatred. Dieudonné refused to apologize and denounced Zionism and the Jewish lobby. Dieudonné approached Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front political party that he had fought earlier, and the men became political allies and friends. Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson appeared in one of his shows in 2008. Dieudonné described Holocaust remembrance as "memorial pornography". Dieudonné was convicted in court eight times on antisemitism charges. Dieudonné subsequently found himself with increasing frequency banned from mainstream media, and many of his shows were cancelled by local authorities. Active on the internet and in his Paris theater, Dieudonné has continued to have a following. His quenelle signature gesture became notorious in 2013, particularly after footballer Nicolas Anelka used the gesture during a match in December 2013. His recent appearances and videos are often rants in which the "Jewish lobby" and "Israel lobby" are characterised as controlling things. After Dieudonné was recorded during a performance mocking a Jewish journalist, suggesting it was a pity that he was not sent to the gas chambers, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls stated that Dieudonné was "no longer a comedian" but was rather an "anti-Semite and racist" and that he would seek to ban all Dieudonné''s public gatherings as a public safety risk. The ban on his shows has been upheld by French courts. Dieudonné has also been known to associate with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (President of Iran from 2005 to 2013), who has himself been accused of describing the Holocaust as a myth. On 25 February 2015 Ahmadinejad Tweeted "Visiting an old friend, a great artist." the tweet included photographs of himself and Dieudonné, arms around each other, smiling. The two also met in 2009 during a visit by Dieudonné to the Islamic Republic of Iran where they reportedly discussed their shared anti-Zionist views.

Anita Garvin (February 11, 1907 – July 7, 1994) was an American actress and comedian who appeared in both silent and sound films. She is best known for her work with comedians Laurel and Hardy and Charley Chase.

Garvin was born in New York City.] Her two sisters who danced in vaudeville encouraged her talents. At age 12, she lied to an agent saying she was "almost sixteen" and got a job being a bathing beauty for one of Mack Sennett''s stage shows. The following year she joined the Ziegfeld Follies. She took pride in being the only woman allowed to touch Will Rogers''s ropes. She also appeared in Earl Carroll Vanities.

Garvin went on tour with the musical Sally staying with the show for two seasons, then decided to stay in California when the tour left that stop in 1924. In Hollywood, Garvin began working for Christie Film Company''s comedies. She recalled her co-star Bobby Vernon dropping butter on the floor onto which she stepped and tumbled, cementing her career as a comedian. Charles Lamont brought her over to work for Educational Pictures. In 1926, Hal Roach took her under contract, where she appeared in many silent films with Charley Chase, James Finlayson, and Max Davidson as well as playing occasional supporting roles in feature films. Standing around 6 feet tall, "her regal countenance and deadpan expression" made her the perfect comic foil.

Roach later considered her "one of his finest actresses." Reflecting upon her frequent co-star Stan Laurel, Garvin observed: "One thing about Stan--with apologies to a lot of directors--they thought they were directing him. And they thought they were directing the picture. But Stan was the one...He was very clever about it. The director was never cognizant of the fact that he was not doing all the directing. Stan''s mind was going all the time, always thinking of gags and things to do. The script didn''t mean a thing." Garvin appeared in a total of eleven Laurel and Hardy films. In 1928, she was teamed with Marion Byron as a short-lived female version of Laurel and Hardy. Along with Edgar Kennedy, Byron and Garvin appeared in A Pair of Tights, an "acknowledged masterpiece."', 'New York City, New York, USA', 1, '/c8ZkhmfwXVZwoITAkCcDrj26U72.jpg'),

Gertrude Astor (November 9, 1887 – November 9, 1977) was an American motion picture character actress, who began her career playing trombone on a riverboat.

Born in Lakewood, Ohio as a member of the Astor family and of German descent, Astor joined a woman''s band as a trombone player and toured the states. In New York she left the band to obtain film work and got a job as an extra before her career took off. Astor was a prolific performer, between 1915 and 1962 she appeared in over 250 movies. Her first known credit is in a Biograph short in 1915. She then became a contract player at Universal. A tall, angular and beautiful woman, Astor frequently towered over the leading men of the era; thus, she was most frequently utilized in comedy roles as aristocrats, golddiggers and "heroine''s best pal".

Her best-known silent appearances were as the visiting stage star in Stage Struck (1925) with Gloria Swanson, as the vamp who plants stolen money on Harry Langdon in The Strong Man (1926), and as Laura LaPlante''s wisecracking travelling companion in The Cat and the Canary (1927).

Astor worked prolifically at Hal Roach studios with such headliners as Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang, and especially Charley Chase. She was also kept busy at Columbia Pictures'' short subjects unit.

She continued to play bits in feature films throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. She was briefly glimpsed as the first murder victim in the Sherlock Holmes adventure The Scarlet Claw and was among the ranks of dress extras in 1956''s Around the World in Eighty Days. Her last appearance was in John Ford''s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.

In her later years, Astor was a welcome guest at several Sons of the Desert gatherings, and became an honorary member of the Way Out West tent.

She died in Woodland Hills, California from a stroke. She is interred in the Abbey of Psalms in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, CA.', 'Lakewood, Ohio, USA', 1, '/jjIoqFS6mmfZFlhX8pcBhPVzIBJ.jpg'),

Babe London (August 28, 1901 – November 29, 1980) was an

American actress and comedian, most remembered for her onetime-only partnership

with Oliver Hardy, in the 1931''s Laurel and Hardy''s two-reeler Our Wife.

Born Jean Glover in 1901 in Des Moines, Iowa, London began

her screen career as a teenager making her film debut in The Expert Eloper in

1919. She then appeared in A Day''s Pleasure, performing opposite Charlie

Chaplin. The two played seasick tourists on an excursion boat. London appeared

in more than 50 silent films, including The Perfect Flapper, The Boob and the

1928 version of Tillie''s Punctured Romance starring W. C. Fields. She worked

with all the funny men of the day, including Harry Langdon and Chester Conklin.

At the height of her career, London weighed 255 pounds. Later,

a heart condition necessitated a loss of 100 pounds, and her movie offers

declined along with her weight. She never regained her earlier success. Her

last most notable role was that of the toothless nurse Nora that Shemp Howard

has eyes for in the Three Stooges film Scrambled Brains. Her last film

appearance was in 1960''s Sex Kittens Go to College.

In the late 1950s, London began a second career as a painter

and devoted the last 20 years of her life to depicting on canvas the early

years of Hollywood. She titled the series The Vanishing Era.', 'Des Moines - Iowa - USA', 1, '/mCuOXOCL3QlHYXBGs1o9XFgBVRa.jpg'),

At the age of seven things started to change for Allen due to a dangerous environment and some of his neighbors in Compton. He, his mother and two older sisters moved into a home in Rialto, California. His first foray into the entertainment business was dancing on Soul Train. This first love would lead him to his true love... Acting! Allen''s senior year in high school is when the acting bug bit him. He performed in numerous comedy shows and pep rallies. After graduating he took some acting classes in the Inland Empire which put him in front of a manager by the name of Vance from Advance LA. This would help him make the transition to Los Angeles. His first appearance as a working actor would come soon afterwards. Starring in a PBS educational program called "Madison Heights" Allen portrayed the role of "Tyrone" a young street thug. Noticing the charisma and potential in Allen, Vance would later refer him to a woman that would change his life forever...Mrs. Bobbie Shaw Chance. Her alumni is some of the most wanted actors in the business such as Drew Barrymore, Giovanni Ribisi, Kiko Ellworth, and many other of Hollywood''s elite. With Bobbie''s help and that of an extraordinary fellow student by the name of Choice Skinner, Allen would grow from a young man with an extreme amount of raw energy and charisma to a bona fide "A" list actor. Allen quickly grew to love and understand the craft of acting. Shortly after joining Bobbie''s acting studio, Allen booked his first big screen appearance in the hit film "Friday After Next" as a juvenile delinquent that would attack Ice Cube and Mike Epps with a pool stick. Currently Allen has a recurring role on the Emmy award winning soap opera "The Young and The Restless" as Jamal.

Harrowgate College-educated, straight-backed, balding and well-intoned, Parker caricatured a multitude of unctuous, stiff-upper-lip butlers, man-servants or waiters, though his performances could, at times, verge on the brink of being camp. When driven to frustration his characters commonly resorted to incoherent twitter or wild gesticulation.

Parker was trained under Marie Tempest and George Alexander in England. He first acted on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre as Wilfred Tavish in Arthur Wing Pinero''s "The "Mind the Paint" Girl" in 1912. He was well served with further roles in hit plays like "Hobson''s Choice" (1915), "Artists and Models" (1924) and "The Red Robe" (1928). He was at first prone to reject film offers, professing to favor acting on stage. Nonetheless, the celluloid medium eventually beckoned, enticing him to sign with the East Coast-based studio Thanhouser in 1915.

In 1964, Lindsey was cast as the slow-witted but kindly "Goober Beasley" on The Andy Griffith Show. His character was later renamed "Goober Pyle" to tie him to his cousin Gomer Pyle, slow-witted country boy played by Jim Nabors, also from Alabama.

As Lindsey started his portrayal as Goober, he also had a minor role in the Walter Brennan series The Tycoon on ABC. Lindsey played a sailor in the 1964 film Ensign Pulver, the sequel to Mister Roberts. He also had a role in a Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode entitled Submarine Sunk Here.

Steinbauer won the Princess Grace Award for his 2009 documentary feature, Winnebago Man.The film follows the Internet phenomenon created by a series of twenty-year-old outtakes from a Winnebago sales video featuring the profane outbursts of the salesman, Jack Rebney. Originally intended as an inside joke, the video spread across the globe and earned Jack the title of "The Angriest Man in the World". The documentary explores the story of the clip’s origin and how it affects the man who never knew it existed. The film had its world premiere at The South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, on March 14, 2009. Winnebago Man won the Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature at the Sarasota Film Festival in April 2009. The documentary was voted a Top Ten Audience Favorite at the Hot Docs Film Festival in May 2009.

Steinbauer''s documentary short, The Next Tim Day, chronicled the rise of entrepreneur Tim Day from the housing projects of Galveston, Texas to the shimmering lights of the Sundance Film Festival. The documentary is a quintessential American story about a salesman/hustler who creates a one-man television network called “Hood News.”

Gerardo Luigi "Jerry" Colonna (September 17, 1904 – November 22, 1986) was an American musician, actor, comedian, singer, songwriter and trombonist best remembered as the zaniest of Bob Hope''s sidekicks in Hope''s popular radio shows and films of the 1940s and 1950s.

With his pop-eyed facial expressions and walrus-sized handlebar moustache, Colonna was known for singing loudly "in a comic caterwaul," according to Raised on Radio author Gerald Nachman, and for his catchphrase, "Who''s Yehudi?", uttered after many an old joke, although it usually had nothing to do with the joke. The line was believed to be named for violin virtuoso Yehudi Menuhin, and the search for Yehudi became a running gag on the Hope show.

Colonna featured in three of the popular Hope-Crosby Road films: Road to Singapore (1940) as Achilles Bombassa, Road to Rio (1947) as a Cavalry captain and The Road to Hong Kong (1962) in a cameo role. He can also be seen in the Fred Allen vehicle, It''s in the Bag! (1945), as psychiatrist Dr. Greenglass, and he made a brief appearance with Hope in the "Wife, Husband and Wolf" sketch in Star Spangled Rhythm. In 1956 he performed the featured song "My Lucky Charm" in the film Meet Me in Las Vegas, starring Dan Dailey and Cyd Charisse.

He provided the voice of the March Hare in the Walt Disney animated film version of Alice in Wonderland (1951) (another radio legend, Ed Wynn, voiced the Mad Hatter) and also lent his zany narration style to several Disney shorts, including Casey at the Bat (1946) and The Brave Engineer (1950).', 'Boston, Massachusetts, USA', 1, '/toNZjTxmuc6QczOUZKgWKRp8jUX.jpg'),

Les Blank (b. 27 November 1935, Tampa, Florida, United States) is an American documentary filmmaker best known for his portraits of American traditional musicians.

Blank attended Tulane University in New Orleans, where he received a B.A. in English literature and an M.F.A. in theater. He had also studied communications at the University of Southern California.[1][2] Following his university education he founded his own production company, Flower Films, and most of his films since that time have been independently produced, often with the assistance of grants from cultural agencies, both governmental and non-governmental.

Most of his films focus on American traditional music forms including (among others) blues, Appalachian, Cajun, Creole, Tex-Mex, polka, tamburitza, and Hawaiian musics. Many of these films represent the only filmed documents of musicians who are now deceased.

Blank''s films focusing on musical subjects often spend much of their running time focusing not on the music itself but on the music''s cultural context, portraying the surroundings from which these American roots musics come.

Other notable films on non-musical subjects include a film about garlic and another about gap-toothed women, as well as two films about German film director Werner Herzog: Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe (1980) and Burden of Dreams (1982), the latter about the filming of Herzog''s Fitzcarraldo. The Maestro; King of The Cowboy Artists (1995) and Sworn To The Drum (1995) were Blank''s last two films using 16mm film. He now works in digital. His most recent film, All In This Tea, which was co-directed by Gina Leibrecht, is a profile of the western Marin County-based tea importer and adventurer David Lee Hoffman. In 2007 Blank was awarded the prestigious Edward MacDowell Medal in the Arts.

Les''s son, Harrod Blank, has also become a documentary filmmaker.

Blank lives in Berkeley, California. His company, Flower Films, is based in El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California.

        (142865, 'Jean Vigo', '1905-04-26', 'Jean Vigo was a French film director who helped establish poetic realism in film in the 1930s; he was a posthumous influence on the French New Wave of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Vigo was born to Emily Clero and the prominent Catalan militant anarchist Eugeni Bonaventura de Vigo i Sallés (who adopted the name Miguel Almereyda—an anagram of "y''a la merde", which translates as "there''s shit"). Much of Jean''s early life was spent on the run with his parents. His father was imprisoned and murdered in Fresnes Prison on 13 August 1917. The young Vigo was subsequently sent to boarding school under an assumed name, Jean Sales, to conceal his identity.

Vigo is noted for two films that affected the future development of both French and world cinema: Zero for Conduct (1933) and L''Atalante (1934). Zero for Conduct was approvingly described by critic David Thomson as "forty-four minutes of sustained, if roughly shot anarchic crescendo." L''Atalante was Vigo''s only full-length feature. The simple story of a newly married couple splitting and reuniting is notable for the way it effortlessly merges rough, naturalistic filmmaking with shimmering, dreamlike sequences and effects. Thomson described the result as "not so much a masterpiece as a definition of cinema, and thus a film that stands resolutely apart from the great body of films." 

His career began with two other films: À propos de Nice ("about Nice," 1930), a subversive silent film inspired by Soviet newsreels which considered social inequity in the resort town of Nice; and Jean Taris, Swimming Champion (1931), a study of swimmer Jean Taris. None of his four films were financial successes; at one point, with his and his wife''s health suffering, Vigo was forced to sell his camera.

Vigo was married and had a daughter, Luce Vigo (a film critic) in 1931.

Zero for Conduct was banned by the French government until after the war, and L''Atalante was mutilated by its distributor. By this point, Vigo was too ill to strenuously fight the matter. Both films have outlived their detractors; L''Atalante was chosen as the 10th-greatest film of all time in Sight &amp; Sound''s 1962 poll, and as the 6th-best in its 1992 poll. In the late 1980s a 1934 copy of L''Atalante was found in the British National Film and Television Archive, and became a key element in the restoration of the film to its original version.

Writing on Vigo''s career in The New York Times, film critic Andrew Johnston stated: "The ranks of the great film directors are short on Keatses and Shelleys, young artists cut off in their prime, leaving behind a handful of great works that suggest what might have been. But one who qualifies is Jean Vigo, the French director who died of tuberculosis at age 29 in 1934.”

Žarko Lauševic is a Serbian actor. Considered to be one of the most talented actors of his generation, Zarko Lausevic became a leading actor early in his career. By the age of 33, he was a major star across the former Yugoslavia on both stage and screen, displaying a wide range of dramatic skills. In July 1993, Lausevic''s entered into a quarrel with a group of local youths, together with his brother. This escalated into a fist fight, culminating in Lausevic firing multiple rounds from his handgun, killing two of the youths and seriously wounding one. Sentenced by a Montenegrin (republic) court to prison initially, his conviction was overturned by the Yugoslav (appellate) court on the grounds that the first-instance court had improperly dismissed Lausevic''s self-defense argument, and the punishment was drastically reduced. Lausevic served 4 years and 7 months in prison before his release. But Lausevic faced further legal battles. There were appeals by the Montenegrin prosecution, numerous retrials and inconsistent, ad hoc rulings by the Montenegrin court system. In 2001, the prison sentence was reinstated to 13 years by the Montenegrin courts.  In the late 1990s, Lausevic left Yugoslavia for the United States. It is speculated that the move was made due to possible revenge by families of the deceased. Zarko Lausevic has been living in the United States since and is currently fighting deportation proceedings.

David "Dave" Fleischer (July 14, 1894 – June 25, 1979) was an American animator film director and film producer, best known as a co-owner of Fleischer Studios with his older brother Max Fleischer. He was a native of New York City.

Sometime around 1913-1914, Dave began working as a film cutter for the American branch of Pathé, the French company that was the world''s largest film production and distribution company, and the largest manufacturer of film equipment, in the first decades of the 20th Century.

Dave Fleischer was notable during the brothers'' early days as the rotoscope model for their first character, Koko the Clown. He went on to become director and later producer of the studio''s output. Although he is credited as "director" of every film released by the Fleischer studio from 1921 to 1942, the lead animators actually performed directorial duties, and Fleischer mainly served as producer. Among the cartoon series Fleischer supervised during this period were Talkartoons, Betty Boop Cartoons, Popeye the Sailor, Color Classics and several others; Popeye would go on to be the top rival of Mickey Mouse. He also supervised two animated features released through Paramount Pictures, Gulliver''s Travels (1939) and Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941). The debt Fleischer Studios owed to Paramount for the budgets of those features, worsened by the lack of success that came from the studio''s non-Popeye cartoons, was called in by Paramount; this forced the brothers to give the studio to Paramount on May 24, 1941. However, both were still able to remain in charge of Fleischer Studios for a time.

Fleischer was asked by Paramount to put the popular comic book hero Superman into a cartoon series. The big-budget Superman series became the most successful cartoon of the late period of Fleischer Studios. However, relations between Dave and Max were deteriorating. The feud starting simmering after the married Dave began an adulterous affair with his Miami secretary in 1938, and was followed by more personal and professional disputes.

In April 1942 Fleischer, no longer able to cooperate with his brother, left the company to become President of Screen Gems at Columbia Pictures, although he remained co-manager of Fleischer Studios until Paramount reorganized the studio in May 1942 after Max and Dave''s contracts expired. Now owned wholly by Paramount, the studio was re-organized as Famous Studios, although the name wasn''t officially adopted until May 1943.

In the late-1940s, Fleischer moved over to Universal, where he became a special effects expert and general problem-solver, working on films such as Francis (1950), The Birds (1963), and Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967).

Fleischer died of a stroke on June 25, 1979 in Woodland Hills, California, having spent over a decade in retirement.', 'New York City, New York, USA', 1, '/343V4i0ekU4crsfk88YtPqFQld7.jpg'),

Dorothy Sebastian (April 26, 1903 – April 8, 1957) was an American film and stage actress.

Sebastian was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama. In her youth, she aspired to be a dancer and a film actress. Her family frowned on both ambitions, however, so she fled to New York at the age of 15. Upon her arrival in New York City, Sebastian''s southern drawl was thick enough to "cut with a knife". She followed around theatrical agents before returning at night to a $12-a-month room, after being consistently rejected.

Sebastian''s first contact in Hollywood was Robert Kane, who gave her a film test at United Studios. She performed in George White''s Scandals and later co-starred with Joan Crawford and Anita Page for a popular series of MGM romantic dramas including Our Dancing Daughters (1928) and Our Blushing Brides (1930). Sebastian also appeared in 1929''s Spite Marriage, wherein she was cast opposite her then-lover Buster Keaton.

By the mid-1930s, Sebastian was semi-retired from acting after marrying Hopalong Cassidy star William Boyd. After their 1936 divorce, she returned to acting appearing in mostly bit parts. Her last onscreen appearance was in the 1948 film The Miracle of the Bells.

Sebastian married actor William Boyd in December 1930 in Las Vegas, Nevada. They began a relationship after meeting on the set of His First Command in 1929. They divorced in 1936.

In 1947, Sebastian married Miami Beach businessman Harold Shapiro to whom she remained married until her death.

On April 8, 1957, Sebastian died of cancer at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. She is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Dorothy Sebastian has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6655 Hollywood Blvd.', 'Birmingham, Alabama, USA', 1, '/cOL51TnyGuz68l85iLT5L94xFxv.jpg'),

Lillian Lawrence (February 17, 1868 – May 7, 1926) was an American theatre and silent film actress. Her daughter Ethel Grey Terry was also an actress.  Lawrence was born in either Alexandria, Virginia or Alexander, West Virginia but moved to San Francisco at the age of two. She made her stage debut there as a 13-year-old girl as a chess piece in the operetta The Royal Middy. Following that, she sang opera for the California Theatre for three years. At age 20, she joined a touring company, followed by a role in The Two Orphans. Afterwards, she joined a repertory theatre in Oakland.

In 1882 at the age of 14, she gave birth to her daughter Ethel, but Lawrence remained unmarried (she was single her entire life).

In 1897, she joined the Castle Square Stock Company, another repertory theatre. As stock theatres often put on new plays on a weekly basis, by summer 1897, she had taken on over 300 operatic and 500 dramatic roles over the course of her career. She spent six years with the company and was known as the company''s "Leading Lady". Her popularity was such that when she temporarily left the group in 1901 on a 16-month sabbatical, she received a rousing ovation and tribute.

She joined Ethel in Los Angeles in 1919 and appeared in both films and theatre while there. Lawrence died of heart disease in 1926 at her daughter''s home in Beverly Hills. Her ashes are interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.', 'Alexandria, Virginia, USA', 1, '/1iDo1SUXgAcMnkrTZR1ICtRMZ1b.jpg'),

Jeho otcem byl herec Jiří Kostka. Po maturitě na Vyšší hospodářské škole složil v roce 1957 úspěšně zkoušky na DAMU. Studium ale nedokončil a v roce 1960 nastoupil do Městských divadel pražských. První filmové role ztvárnil s úspěchem už v 2. ročníku DAMU, ale definitivně se u diváků i odborné kritiky prosadil v roce 1960 snímkem VYŠŠÍ PRINCIP, kde hrál jednoho ze studentů popravených za stanného práva.

Následovala strmá herecká kariéra. V následujících desetiletích patřil k nejobsazovanějším a velice populárním českým hercům. S přehledem hrál hlavní i vedlejší postavy, z významných rolí lze uvést např. postavu sedláka Petra ze snímku Karla Zemana BLÁZNOVA KRONIKA, šlechtického mladíka v televizní středověké detektivce ZLOČIN NA ZLENICÍCH HRADĚ, šlechtice Millese z historického televizního filmu Ludvíka Ráži PRIC A CHUĎAS nebo dvojroli bratrů Burešových coby pilotů kosmické lodi ve sci-fi Jindřicha Poláka ZÍTRA VSTANU A OPAŘÍM SE ČAJEM.

Měl mimořádně rozsáhlý herecký rejstřík, byl obsazován do nejrůznějších žánrů od psychologických dramat přes dobrodružné filmy až k ryzím komediím. Ty měl ostatně nejraději. Diváci si ho mohou pamatovat jako zákeřného Carlose ve Vorlíčkově filmu COŽ TAKHLE DÁT SI ŠPENÁT nebo jako věčně nervózního a uhoněného pana Nováka v komediích PÁTEK NENÍ SVÁTEK a V PODSTATĚ JSME NORMÁLNÍ. Objevil se jako jeden z hlavních hrdinů podprůměrného seriálu INŽENÝRSKÁ ODYSEA.

V 80. letech zájem filmařů o jeho služby poněkud poklesl a více ho vytěžovala televize. Zahrál si v řadě seriálů, mezi ty, kde měl významný prostor, patří SANITKA, SYNOVÉ A DCERY JAKUBA SKLÁŘE nebo MY HOLKY Z MĚSTEČKA. V řadě dalších se objevil v epizodních rolích. V 90. letech se nejčastěji objevoval v televizních pohádkách a inscenacích. Ztvárnil jednoho z kriminalistů v oblíbeném seriálu HŘÍCHY PRO PÁTERA KNOXE a divácky vděčnou postavu penzionovaného vrchního strážmistra Šiktance v úspěšných ČETNICKÝCH HUMORESKÁCH.

Pokud jde o divadelní angažmá, v roce 1974 přešel do Národního divadla, kde hrál v řadě prestižních představení, jako byl Hamlet nebo Vévodkyně valdštejnských vojsk. V roce 1994 přestoupil do souboru Divadla na Vinohradech, kde působí dodnes. Ve významných rolích se objevil např. ve hrách Smutek patří Elektře, Královna Kristina nebo Král se baví. V roce 2003 se stal nositelem divadelní ceny Thálie.

Z rozsáhlé práce na poli dabingu vyčnívá např. postava Mikoláše (František Velecký) z historické fresky MARKÉTA LAZAROVÁ či esesáka Kukucka (Oleg Tabakov) ze snímku KUKAČKA V TEMNÉM LESE. Za nadabování detektiva Poirota ve stejnojmenném seriálu obdržel cenu Františka Filipovského.

První manželství, ze kterého zůstaly Petru Kostkovi dvě dcery, skončilo tragickou autonehodou jeho ženy Ingrid Kostkové-Vavrouchové. Ovdovělý herec se oženil s kolegyní z Městských divadel pražských Carmen Mayerovou. Narodila se jim dcera Tereza Kostková, dnes úspěšná herečka a moderátorka.

However, this role occurred late in his career,  which consisted of much more than just this western character. Not much  is known about Renaldo''s early life. In fact, his date and place of  birth is still questioned. The usual given birth date is April 23, 1904.  His birthplace has been generally stated as Spain--he has said that his  first memories as a child were in Spain--although Romania and even New  Jersey have been mentioned as well. An orphan, he never knew his actual  parents and was never able to ascertain the exact date and place of his  birth. He was raised and educated in various European countries and  arrived in the US in the early 1920s as a stoker on a Brazilian coal  ship. Entering the country on a 90-day seaman''s permit, he stayed when  his ship caught fire at the dock and burned to the waterline. A paltry  existence as a portrait painter forced him to seek other work, and he  somehow found his way into films as a producer of short features, which  in turn led to on-camera work as an actor with MGM in 1928. The studio  capitalized on his dashing Hispanic looks and initially typed him as a  "Latin lover", but it didn''t last long. In the early 1930s his career  was interrupted when he was arrested and faced deportation due to his  illegal immigrant status. The actor was eventually pardoned by President  Franklin D. Roosevelt--his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt,  had bought one of Renaldo''s paintings, looked into his case and  persuaded her husband to pardon him. He returned to minor films for both  Republic and Monogram, alternating as heroic sidekick and villain. He  co-starred as one of the Three Mesquiteers in the revamped film series,  and showed up regularly in 1930s and 1940s cliffhangers, including The Painted Stallion (1937), Jungle Menace (1937), Zorro Rides Again (1937), King of the Mounties (1942), Secret Service in Darkest Africa (1943) The Tiger Woman (1944). In 1945 he began the Cisco Kid film series and transferred the character successfully to TV in the early 1950s, with Leo Carrillo  as faithful sidekick Pancho. Renaldo made the character clean-shaven  and more of a do-gooder than the roguish bandit who actually was in the  books.

All three were too often given colorless heroes to play on film and/or TV -- roles that played off their charm but seldom tested their talent.

Born on February 27, 1934 as Van Zandt Jarvis Williams, he was the son of a cattle rancher. He majored in animal husbandry and business at Texas Christian University but moved to Hawaii which changed the course of his life. While operating a salvage company and a skin-diving school during the mid-1950s, he was approached by Elizabeth Taylor and husband/producer Mike Todd, who were filming there. Encouraged by Todd to try his luck, Van arrived in Hollywood with no experience. Todd perished in a plane crash before he was able to help Van, but the young hopeful ventured on anyway, taking some acting/voice lessons, and was almost immediately cast in dramatic TV roles.

Warner Brothers had a keen eye for this type of photogenic hunk and smartly signed Van. Fitting in perfectly, he was soon showing just how irresistible he was as a clean-cut private eye on the series "Bourbon Street Beat (1959)". Although the show lasted only one season, Warners carried his Kenny Madison character into the more popular adventure drama Surfside 6 (1960) opposite fellow pin-up / blond beefcake bookend Troy Donahue. Series-wise, Van tried comedy next opposite "Walter Brennan in The Tycoon (1964)". After his contract expired at Warners, 20th Century-Fox handed him his most vividly recalled role, that of the emerald-suited superhero "The Green Hornet (1966)" with the late Bruce Lee as his partner Kato. The show, inspired by the huge cult hit "Batman (1966)" enjoyed a fast start but, like its predecessor, met an equally untimely finish.

Never a strong draw in films, Van revealed quite a bit of himself (literally) in his debut in "Tall Story (1960)" coming out of a shower. He was handed a typically staid second lead in "The Caretakers (1963)". Continuing well into the 1970s to guest sporadically on the TV scene in classics like "The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961)", "Love, American Style (1969)", "Mission: Impossible (1966)", "The Big Valley (1965)", "Nanny and the Professor (1970)", "Barnaby Jones (1973)", and "The Rockford Files (1974)". Another starring series attempt with "Westwind (1975)" failed to make the grade and he soon let his career go. Van went on quite successfully in business with telecommunications, real estate and law enforcement supplies among his ventures. With his glossy, pretty-boy years far behind him, he has not felt the need to look back except for an occasional autograph convention.

Rosemary Theby (April 8, 1892 – November 10, 1973) was an American film actress. She appeared in some 250 films between 1911 and 1940.

Born Rosemary Theresa Theby in St. Louis, Missouri, Theby studied at Sargent''s School in New York. A contemporary newspaper account described her as being of "medium-height, well proportioned, with regular features and dark hair".

Her first film experience came in the Vitagraph production of The Wager. By 1915, she was a star for the Universal film company. During World War I Theby took care of a refugee from Lithuania. After being educated and cared for by Theby, the young woman became her maid during an acute shortage of maids in Hollywood, in 1920.

As Miss Corintee in The Great Love (1918), Theby played the part of a German spy with great skill. The film was written and directed by D.W. Griffith. This was a vamp role which she began to play frequently after depicting characters in slapstick comedies. Theby played a Chinese vampire in Clung, a Fox Film production directed by Emmett Flynn. Later she began to portray more serious women.

Theby was solely a film actress. She declined an offer to accompany Chauncey Olcott to appear on stage for $85 per week. At the time she was earning $125 weekly in movies. She later regretted her decision because of the experience she would have gained.

Theby was married to fellow actor and director Harry Myers. After Meyers'' death in 1938, she married Truitt Hughes to whom she remained married until her death. She lived for years at 1907 Wilcox Avenue in Los Angeles.

Theby supported Calvin Coolidge in the 1924 presidential election. Theby enjoyed playing golf, wearing her hair in a Bob cut, and possessed a preoccupation with personal cleanliness. On screen she appeared tall and willowy, entering a scene, according to one review in the Los Angeles Times, with a "sensuous glide".

Theby died of circulatory shock on November 10, 1973, at the age of 81.', 'St. Louis, Missouri, USA', 1, '/eMY175j7k126FlyQwcInCWwI0Xc.jpg'),

Anthony Charles Lynton Blair (born 6 May 1953) is a former British Labour Party politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2 May 1997 to 27 June 2007. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sedgefield from 1983 to 2007 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007. He resigned from all of these positions in June 2007.

Tony Blair was elected Leader of the Labour Party in the leadership election of July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under his leadership, the party adopted the term "New Labour" and moved away from its traditional left wing position towards the centre ground. Blair subsequently led Labour to a landslide victory in the 1997 general election. At 43 years old, he became the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair''s government implemented a number of 1997 manifesto pledges, introducing the minimum wage, Human Rights Act and Freedom of Information Act, and carrying out devolution, establishing the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

Blair''s role as Prime Minister was particularly visible in foreign and security policy, including in Northern Ireland, where he was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. From the start of the War on Terror in 2001, Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of US President George W. Bush, notably by participating in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair is the Labour Party''s longest-serving Prime Minister, the only person to have led the Labour Party to three consecutive general election victories, and the only Labour Prime Minister to serve consecutive terms more than one of which was at least four years long.

He was succeeded as Leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown. On the day he resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East. In May 2008, Blair launched his Tony Blair Faith Foundation. This was followed in July 2009 by the launching of the Faith and Globalisation Initiative with Yale University in the USA, Durham University in the UK and the National University of Singapore in Asia to deliver a postgraduate programme in partnership with the Foundation.

His films variously merge surrealism with homoeroticism and the occult, and have been described as containing "elements of erotica, documentary, psychodrama, and spectacle." Anger himself has been described as "one of America''s first openly gay filmmakers, and certainly the first whose work addressed homosexuality in an undisguised, self-implicating manner," and his "role in rendering gay culture visible within American cinema, commercial or otherwise, is impossible to overestimate." Some of his particularly homoerotic works, such as Fireworks (1947) and Scorpio Rising (1964), were produced prior to the legalisation of homosexuality in the United States. He has also focused upon occult themes in many of his films, being fascinated by the notorious English occultist Aleister Crowley, and is a follower of Crowley''s religion, Thelema. This influence is evident from films like Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954), Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969) and Lucifer Rising (1972).

Anger has described filmmakers such as Auguste and Louis Lumière and Georges Méliès as influences, and has been cited as an important influence on later film directors like Martin Scorsese, David Lynch and John Waters.He has also been described as having "a profound impact on the work of many other filmmakers and artists, as well as on music video as an emergent art form using dream sequence, dance, fantasy, and narrative." During the 1960s and 70s he associated and worked with a number of different figures in popular culture and the occult, including Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey, sexologist Alfred Kinsey, artist Jean Cocteau, playwright Tennessee Williams and musicians Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page and Marianne Faithfull. He is also the author of the controversial best seller Hollywood Babylon (1959) and its sequel Hollywood Babylon II (1986), in which he claims to expose many of the rumours and secrets of Hollywood celebrities.

Phillip Borsos (May 5, 1953 - February 13, 1995) was Canadian film director and film producer.

Borsos showed an early interest in film-making while attending high school in Maple Ridge, B.C. He studied film at the Banff Centre School for Fine Arts and at the Vancouver School of Art, now the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design.

His early work included several shorts notable for their cinematography and pacing. Three outstanding documentaries done in his early years are Cooperage (1976), Spartree (1977) and Nails (1979). All three won Best Theatrical Short at the Canadian Film Awards, "The Genie Awards", and also received a nomination for an Oscar in the Documentary Short category. He began working on feature-length films and his first, "The Grey Fox", earned him a "Best Director" and "Best Film" at the Genies in 1983. It told the story of Bill Miner, Canada''s first train robber and starred Richard Farnsworth.

He followed that success with The Mean Season (1985) and One Magic Christmas (1985). Production problems dogged his biopic Bethune: The Making of a Hero (1990) which starred Donald Sutherland as Dr. Norman Bethune. His final film Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog was produced in 1994. During the same time he was diagnosed with leukemia. He died February 2, 1995 at age 41.

Barbara Bedford (born Violet May Rose; July 19, 1903 – October 25, 1981) was an American actress who appeared in dozens of silent movies. Her career declined after the introduction of sound, but she continued to appear in small roles until 1945.

After high school she set out for Hollywood. She had written many fan letters to actor William S. Hart, and he helped her get a small role in his 1920 movie The Cradle of Courage. While working as an extra that same year on The White Circle, she was noticed by fellow cast member John Gilbert, who recommended her to director Maurice Tourneur. Tourneur cast her alongside Gilbert in Deep Waters. Tourneur also cast her in The Last of the Mohicans, where she was the love interest for Alan Roscoe, whom she later married in real life.

In 1925 she appeared opposite Hart in his final film, Tumbleweeds, a key western of the silent period. She starred in the 1926 silent film Old Loves and New and in Mockery with Lon Chaney the following year.

When her career declined after the switch to sound, she signed with MGM in 1936 to play bit and extra parts. Her last known film appearance was in 1945.', 'Eastman, Wisconsin, USA', 1, '/l38SsTAJXINLIaXpzZH3LR486gp.jpg'),

Paired up in many a low-budget WWII-era musical, she was best known for her dancing feet, but she was no slouch in the singing department and her buoyant personality added plenty of zest to the escapist fare she appeared in.

Christened Margaret O''Rene Ryan, Peggy was, as they say, born in a trunk in 1924 to a pair of vaudeville dancers ("The Merry Dancing Ryans") and, by age two, the pint-sized scene-stealer was already selling her heart out on stage alongside her parents. No glamor girl, Peggy had a very plaintive face, prominent nose and gangly figure, similar to a Virginia Weidler, so she was wise enough to play it up for laughs. Discovered by George Murphy, the young girl earned a part in Universal''s enjoyable tune fest Top of the Town(1937), where the little Irish charmer managed to steal a dance alongside Murphy. Other movies beckoned, sometimes in teary dramas such as The Women Men Marry (1937) and The Grapes of Wrath (1940). With the movie What''s Cookin''? (1942), she teamed with O''Connor for the first time. The two were a sensation and sparked many musical programmers with their clowning, mugging, intricate dance steps, and indefatigable style. The jitterbugging twosome romped through Private Buckaroo (1942), Give Out, Sisters(1942), Get Hep to Love (1942), Top Man (1943), The Merry Monahans (1944), Chip Off the Old Block (1944) and Bowery to Broadway (1944) during their peak. During this period she married James Cross and had a son, James Michael Cross, who later died in a 1987 car accident.

Peggy began to freelance in post-war years and found employment with other studios. She was paired up with dancer Ray McDonald for the films Shamrock Hill (1949) and All Ashore (1953) and began seeing him off screen as well. They eventually married, had a child named Kerry, and toured together across the U.S. in a nightclub act for a few years until their marriage folded. She decided to retire from films following her third marriage to Hawaiian announcer/emcee/columnist Eddie Sherman. She choreographed book shows here and there ("The Music Man", "Funny Girl"), but basically settled down in Hawaii. In later years, she came out of semi-retirement to appear in a small recurring part as the Governor of Hawaii''s secretary, Millie, on TV''s popular Hawaii Five-O (1968) in 1968. She remained a sporadic presence throughout the run of the show. After teaching tap dancing for decades on the sly, Peggy moved to Las Vegas with her family. A trouper to the end, she formed a group of middle-aged dancers called "The TNT''s" and performed in and about town. In 2003, she suffered her first mini-stroke, dying a year later in what was reported to be complications from multiple strokes on October 30, 2004.', 'Long Beach, California', 1, '/mna4TMDsDI8trrif5QQkQtZY1ci.jpg'),

William Albert "Bill" Dembski (born July 18, 1960) is an American analytic philosopher, known as a proponent of intelligent design and for the concept of specified complexity. He is currently a Research Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Cultural Engagement at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary at Fort Worth, Texas, and a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute''s Center for Science and Culture. He is the author of a number of books about intelligent design, including The Design Inference (1998), Intelligent Design: The Bridge between Science and Theology (1999), The Design Revolution (2004), The End of Christianity (2009), and Intelligent Design Uncensored (2010).

The concept of intelligent design involves the argument that an overarching intelligence is responsible for the complexity of life, and that it can be detected empirically. Dembski postulates that probability theory can be used to prove irreducible complexity, or what he calls specified complexity. The theory of intelligent design in general—and Dembski''s concept of specified complexity in particular—are seen by the scientific community as a contemporary form of creationism, drawn from a conservative Christian set of religious beliefs attempting to portray itself as science.

Barry Norton (born Alfredo Carlos Birabén; June 16, 1905 – August 24, 1956) was an Argentinian-American actor. He appeared in over 90 films, starting in silent films from 1925 until his death in 1956. He is perhaps best known for his role as Juan Harker in Universal Pictures'' Spanish-language version of Drácula in 1931, the English language role of Jonathan Harker originated by David Manners.  Arriving in Hollywood in the 1920s, Norton first appeared as an extra in The Black Pirate (1926) but was soon cast in Fox Films'' The Lily that same year. His big break came when he was given the role of Pvt. "Mother''s Boy" Lewisohn in What Price Glory?, which turned out to be a huge commercial success. He landed substantial roles in Legion of the Condemned and 4 Devils (both 1928), which were also very successful. His acting was well received by audiences and critics at the time, and during the silent era he avoided being typecast as a Latin lover. One theater owner in Golden City, Montana said, "[Norton] has as yet to show me a bad performance. There''s a boy that is a ''natural''."

In the early 1930s, Norton could still get leading roles in major films. Major Hollywood studios started producing alternate-language versions of their prestige productions, and he became one of dozens of Latino actors needed. Drácula was one of these films, but Norton also appeared in Spanish-language versions of Paramount on Parade (1930), The Benson Murder Case (1930), and The Criminal Code (1931). In a few cases, he appeared in both versions of a film. Examples include Storm Over the Andes (Spanish version: Alas sobre El Chaco), The Sea Fiend (El diablo del Mar), and Captain Calamity (El capitan Tormenta), the latter film reuniting him with Lupita Tovar, his romantic interest from Dracula.

In addition to roles in Spanish-territory films, he had roles in numerous major films, usually playing sophisticated Europeans. With the decline in Spanish-language film production in Los Angeles, Norton''s opportunities for leading roles became less and less frequent. Though he had a pleasing voice, his Argentine accent seemed incongruous with his appearance. According to some sources, he never mastered English very well. In 1933, he secured what would be his last important role, playing Jean Parker''s Spanish fiancé in Frank Capra''s Lady for a Day (1933). Although he would continue to work for another 15 years, Norton''s last credited screen role would be Should Husbands Work? (1939). For the rest of his career, Norton continued to reside in Los Angeles and obtain small roles in films.

Wally Albright (September 3, 1925 – August 7, 1999) was an American former child actor.

Albright was born Walton Algernon Albright, Jr. in Burbank, California. He appeared in a number of films during his career, and is notable for appearing in six Our Gang short subjects throughout the early 1930s. Though his tenure with the gang was brief, his role was usually that of the gang leader, alongside Matthew "Stymie" Beard.

Albright played so many roles as a baby that he was quite well known by the time he was three. He appeared in small parts of various films made by Hal Roach Studios. At the end of 1933, when Gus Meins took over directing, Our Gang needed a few new characters. Several older Our Gangers left the series in the summer of 1933 including Dorothy DeBorba and Bobby "Wheezer" Hutchins. Wally would be one of several characters including Scotty Beckett and Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas to debut in 1934 in the Our Gang episode Hi Neighbor. Wally quickly became one of the bigger Our Gang stars. But much to the dismay of Hal Roach and director Gus Meins, Wally voluntarily left the gang and returned to a normal childhood life. However, Albright did play a small role in John Ford''s version of John Steinbeck''s "The Grapes of Wrath," appearing as an older child in the migrant camp. He watches as Ma Joad cooks a stew for her family and tells her, "Me and my brother, we et good." Another child later tells Ma he was lying. "I peeked through their window last night and they was eatin'' fried dough, just like everybody else."

Pauline Garon (September 9, 1900 – August 30, 1965) was a

Canadian-born American silent film, feature film and stage actress.

She was associated with D.W. Griffith when she first came to

Hollywood in 1920. Garon''s first important role came in 1921''s The Power

Within. She also played the body double for Sylvia Breamer in Doubling for

Romeo (1921).

In 1923, she was hailed as Cecil B. DeMille''s big new

discovery. He cast her in only two films. One was Adam''s Rib (1923). She was

selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1923. Even before her

"discovery", Garon had been a steadily rising star. She appeared

opposite Owen Moore in Reported Missing (1922). Garon received much praise for

her role in Henry King''s adaptation of Sonny (1922 film) (1922). She had been

chosen for this role by King after he saw her portray the role in the stage

production on Broadway.

In 1922 she played with Richard Barthelmess in the First

National Pictures release, Sonny. Her role as Florence Crosby brought her to

the brink of stardom. However the ingénue professed no real desire to be a

celebrity. Garon admitted that the thought of the responsibilities of being a

star frightened her.

Garon was making at least five films a year after her

popularity soared. She was playing many lead roles in B movies and supporting

roles in more glamorous films. The 1920s was a wonderful decade for the

actress. She co-starred with Gloria Swanson and John Boles in The Love of Sunya

which opened the lavish Roxy Theatre in New York City on March 11, 1927.

By 1928 Garon''s career began to decline dramatically. By the

end, She appeared mostly in French renditions of Paramount Pictures movies. She

was cast in less popular English films as well.

By the early 1930s, Garon was given very small uncredited

roles. By 1934 she had vanished from film. Garon played a bit part in How Green

Was My Valley (1941). She was in two westerns, Song Of The Saddle (1936) and

The Cowboy and the Blonde (1941).

Garon married three times. She wed actor Lowell Sherman in

February 1926. Sherman''s influence led Garon to refuse a long-term contract

with Paramount. In February 1928 Garon became a citizen of the United States.

She separated from Sherman in August 1927. In February 1940 she eloped with

radio star and actor, Clyde Harland John Alban, to Yuma, Arizona. Garon and

Alban divorced in 1942. She wed comedian Ross Forester and remained with him

until she died.

Garon died at Patton State Hospital, a psychiatric

institution in San Bernardino, California, in 1965. The cause of death was a

brain disorder. She was 63 years old.', 'Montréal - Québec - Canada', 1, '/7ayOcUnk7TXy27WjSjrc0hCFH5.jpg'),

He made his film acting debut in the 1934 film Hat, Coat, and Glove and his theatrical acting debut in a 1935 production of Mary of Scotland. On five occasions he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Direction.

Joseph Anthony was born as Joseph Deuster in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on May 24, 1912. His parents were Leonard Deuster and Sophie Deuster (née Hertz). Anthony attended the University of Wisconsin. He married Perry Wilson. He prepared for the stage at the Pasadena Playhouse from 1931 through 1935 and at the Daykarhanova School from 1935 through 1937.

Joseph Anthony made his New York City directorial debut in April 1948 directing a production of Celebration at the Maxine Elliott Theatre. In 1954, Anthony directed the original production of The Rainmaker, a play of which he would later direct the film adaptation.

Sandy Collora (born August 8, 1968) is an American film director and design artist, best known for the independent short film Batman: Dead End.

Collora was born in Brooklyn, New York. After freelance assignments in comic books and gaming magazines, at age 17 he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dreams in Hollywood.

In 1988, after Collora landed a job at Stan Winston Studios on Leviathan, he became known as a creature designer and sculptor, eventually going on to work with Arnold Kopelson, Rick Baker, and Rob Bottin. Collora spent the next decade in concept design, sculpting, storyboarding, and art direction on major motion pictures. He designed the logo for Jurassic Park, and his designs can be seen in Men in Black, Dogma, The Arrival, The Crow, and Predator 2.

He made his directorial debut in 1999 with the short film Solomon Bernstein''s Bathroom. 1999 also saw the birth of his toy development studio and independent production company Montauk Films.

Collora burst into the limelight with his 2003 short film Batman: Dead End, intended to act as a director''s demonstration reel. After premiering the film at the San Diego Comic Con, it became an internet sensation, and was downloaded more than 600,000 times in the first week. Director Kevin Smith called it "“possibly the truest, best Batman movie ever made".

Collora filmed a similar project, 2004''s World''s Finest, with much of the same cast and crew.

As of 2009, Collora is preparing to release his first feature film, Hunter Prey.

His debut release, My World, followed on November 17, 2009, and was eventually certified platinum in the United States. He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the Billboard Hot 100. His first full studio release, My World 2.0, was released on March 23, 2010 and has since received similar success; it debuted at number one and within the top ten of several countries, and was certified platinum in the United States. It was preceded by the worldwide top-ten single, "Baby," in January 2010. The music video of "Baby" is currently ranked as the most viewed and most discussed YouTube video,  and was the most disliked until being overtaken by Rebecca Black''s song Friday.  Bieber followed-up the release of his debut album with his first headlining tour, the My World Tour, the remix albums My Worlds Acoustic and Never Say Never – The Remixes, and the 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never – which had an opening weekend gross that nearly matched the record for the biggest opening weekend for a concert-film.

Bieber has been nominated and awarded numerous accolades over the past few years, winning Artist of the Year at the 2010 American Music Awards, and being nominated for Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards, among others. Bieber is considered a teen idol, and has been subject to acclaim from fans, as well as criticism and controversy from matters concerning his popularity and image.

Orton is a third-generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Bob Orton, Sr., father "Cowboy" Bob Orton, as well as his uncle Barry O, all competed in the professional wrestling industry.

Before being promoted to the main WWE roster, Orton trained in and wrestled for Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling for a month. He was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where Orton held the OVW Hardcore Championship on two separate occasions.

After signing with WWE, Orton became a member of the stable Evolution, which quickly led to a WWE Intercontinental Championship reign, his first title with the company. Orton also acquired the moniker "The Legend Killer" during a storyline where he began disrespecting Hall of Famers and physically attacking veterans of the industry outside of appropriate restrictions. At age 24, Orton became the youngest person ever to hold the World Heavyweight Championship. With this win, Orton departed from Evolution and a feud with his former stablemates began. In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO. Together, Orton and Edge held the World Tag Team Championship. After the team disbanded, during mid-2007, Orton gained two WWE Championship reigns in one night. Orton formed the group The Legacy with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase in 2008, however, they would disband in 2010 with Orton returning to singles competition. Overall, Orton is a eight-time world champion, having won the World Heavyweight Championship twice and the WWE Championship six times. He is also the winner of the 2009 Royal Rumble match.

Ryan''s best known television role was as Aggie Thompson in The Doris Day Show (in its first incarnation plotline theme), though the gig only lasted a few months. This role was cut short because she was offered the ''replacement'' role on the hit series Green Acres as Doris Ziffel from 1969-1971. Fran was to replace Barbara Pepper, who by then was in poor health. Sadly, Miss Pepper died just five months later of heart ailments, on July 15, 1969.

Her last regular TV role was on The Dave Thomas Comedy Show.

She starred in many feature films, including Flush (1977), Big Wednesday (1978), Take This Job and Shove It (1981), Pale Rider (1985), Chances Are, and in her scene-stealing cameo in 1981''s Stripes, as a tortured cab fare to Bill Murray as the cabbie, in the opening scenes of the comedy film.

Ryan made guest appearances on TV shows ranging from Batman, Adam-12, CHiPs, Quantum Leap, Night Court, Baywatch to The Commish.

Fran Ryan was often compared to actress Marjorie Main; they looked similar to one another. Ryan died on January 15, 2000, at age 83. She is buried in the family plots alongside her mother, at the Holy Sepulchre Catholic Cemetery, in Hayward, California.

George Cisar (July 28, 1912 — June 13, 1979) was an American actor who performed in more than one hundred roles in two decades as a character actor in film and television, often in prominent Hollywood productions. He frequently played background parts such as policemen or bartenders.

In 1949, Cisar co-starred with a young Mike Wallace in the short-lived police drama Stand By for Crime. Among Cisar''s more frequent roles was from 1960 to 1963 as Sgt. Theodore Mooney in thirty-one episodes of CBS''s Dennis the Menace. Oddly, series co-star Gale Gordon took the name "Theodore Mooney" and added the middle initial "J." for his character, Theodore J. Mooney, a tough-minded banker on Lucille Ball''s second sitcom, The Lucy Show.[1]

Cisar portrayed character Donald Hollinger''s father in That Girl, the Marlo Thomas sitcom which aired on ABC, and Cyrus Tankersley on CBS''s The Andy Griffith Show and its sequel Mayberry, R.F.D.

Unbilled in his first film, 1948''s Call Northside 777, he was credited at the bottom of the cast list in his next feature, 1949''s Johnny Holiday. His final film appearance, also near the end of the list, was as Joe the barber in the 1970 Southern racial drama, ...tick...tick...tick....

Sandra Descher (born November 30, 1945) is an American former child actress of the 1950s.

Although born in Burbank, California, she was discovered by accident while on vacation. When Descher was about five years old, her family had travelled across country to New York City where the girl fell in love with the theater after seeing The Red Shoes ballet on Broadway. On the way home, they stopped at Jackson Hole, Wyoming where coincidentally a film was being shot. The director saw her, and needing a child for the film, approached her parents. However, as they had to return home, they contacted the director later. Within six months, Sandy appeared in her first movie, It Grows on Trees, which was released in 1952.

Next she appeared in a brief, but key role in the classic science-fiction film, Them! (1954). She played a catatonic child whose parents have been killed by gigantic ants. Unable to speak, she can only scream "Them", giving the film its title. The movie''s cast included Edmund Gwenn, James Arness and James Whitmore.

That same year, she appeared in her favorite film, The Last Time I Saw Paris. Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald''s famous short story Babylon Revisited, she played Vicky, the daughter of Van Johnson and Elizabeth Taylor. After her mother dies, Vicky is adopted by her mother''s sister, played by Donna Reed. The movie called on her to speak French and to dance ballet. In 1954, she also played a crippled child in a Martin and Lewis film.

Then in 1955 she was in The Prodigal with Lana Turner and then played Gregory Peck''s ten-year-old daughter in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. She also played Susan Walker in The 20th Century-Fox Hour remake of the 1947 film classic, Miracle on 34th Street, opposite Teresa Wright, who played her mother Doris, and Thomas Mitchell, who played Kris Kringle.

In 1956, she played June Allyson''s daughter Debbie in The Opposite Sex, a musical remake of The Women (1939). She also, at Van Johnson''s request, appeared in another movie with him that year, The Bottom of the Bottle (1956). About this time she guest starred with Ann Doran in the CBS western series My Friend Flicka, set on a ranch in Wyoming, and on the CBS Cold War drama, Crusader, the first Brian Keith series.

Her last movie at the age of twelve was the cult favorite Space Children (1958), wearing, to her embarrassment, a bathing suit. In 1959, she appeared with Bette Davis and Leif Erickson in the episode Dark Morning of CBS''s anthology series, The DuPont Show with June Allyson. She guest starred on the ABC sitcom, The Real McCoys, starring Walter Brennan. In 1961, she appeared in the first season of another ABC sitcom, My Three Sons, as Elizabeth Martin, a love interest for Robbie Douglas (Don Grady) in the episode the "The Musician." Descher also appeared in a recurring role as Judy Massey, a daughter of the Loretta Young character, Christine Massey, in the CBS family drama, The New Loretta Young Show (1962–1963), with co-stars Beverly Washburn, Carol Sydes, Dirk Rambo, and Dack Rambo.', 'Burbank, California, USA', 1, '/6FuhxHLYXjkjVdadOv1x6y4ClKM.jpg'),

Standing at 6'' 3", Curtis appeared in films stretching from Charles Starrett to The Three Stooges. In most of his films, he played villains or heavies. He made television appearances on The Lone Ranger and The Range Rider. He appeared in California Gold Rush, Spook Town, The Gene Autry Show, and many others.

Though his forte was in villainous roles, Curtis had a genuine comedic touch. As such, modern audiences will recognize Curtis for his roles in such Three Stooges films as Yes, We Have No Bonanza, You Nazty Spy!, and The Three Troubledoers.  With the help of his friend and actor Russell Hayden, Curtis helped develop Pioneertown, a western movie set location in Southern California that was used for many television and film westerns.', 'Newport, Kentucky, USA', 1, '/7zQalXsJ7qHd3C4DdNQajQhQ4qi.jpg'),

He transferred to The University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh upon his return, where he graduated in 1995 with a degree in Radio/TV/Film.

After his tour was over, Mike found work in the production department for WLUK-TV 11, the FOX affiliate in Green Bay, Wisconsin. His duties included running the audio board during the newscasts and inserting local commercial breaks in-between programs. One of the perks that came along with the job was getting paid to witness The Green Bay Packers march towards their Super Bowl XXXI victory over the New England Patriots.

Carl Anthony Payne II (born May 24, 1969 in Trenton, New Jersey) is an American actor. He studied at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, New York and Howard University, Washington DC. He is best known for his roles as Theo Huxtable''s best friend Cockroach on The Cosby Show and the dimwitted Cole Brown on Martin.

With his crazy hats and dimwitted statements, Payne often comes off as an even goofier counterpart to the antics of Martin Lawrence, star of Martin, the Fox sitcom on which they both appeared. Payne played a similar recurring character on The Cosby Show as Theo''s good buddy Walter "Cockroach" Bradley. A veteran of New York''s professional children''s theater scene, Payne made a relatively smooth transition to young adult roles on the small screen. Payne has appeared in more than 35 commercials and has made guest appearances on several dramatic series. Payne is also known for his singing, including the theme song to the newer "Martin" episodes. He is currently a recurring character on Under One Roof as Calvester''s "hoodlum" friend.

He resides in Los Angeles, California. Currently, Payne participates in various stage plays such as Lord All Men Can''t Be Dogs, Cheaters and Men, Money &amp; Golddiggers, Theres A Stranger In My House. He co-starred in the stage play Love Me or Leave Me, which was turned into a television feature for the Gospel Music Channel in 2010.

Carl is also working on numerous independent comedy projects such as "Like Swirl" featuring Anthony Shaw and Rizzo Gray (Entourage). Carl also does standup comedy.

In 1992, he married Melika, and is now stepfather to singer Bobby Brown''s oldest son Landon. He also has three other sons. He makes a brief cameo appearance in the film The Last Dragon (in the pizza shop.)

Thomas Anthony Connolly (December 31, 1870 - April 28, 1961) was an English-American umpire in Major League Baseball. He officiated in the National League from 1898 to 1900, followed by 31 years of service in the American League from 1901 to 1931. In over half a century as an AL umpire and supervisor, he established the high standards for which the circuit''s arbiters became known, and solidified the reputation for integrity of umpires in the major leagues.

Connolly was born in Manchester, England, and played cricket as a boy. It was not until his family emigrated to the United States in 1885, settling in Natick, Massachusetts, that he saw the game of baseball played for the first time, but he was quickly fascinated and resolved himself to learning as much about the game as he could. He immersed himself in the rule book, and within a few years was umpiring for local games. While working in YMCA games, he was discovered by major league umpire Tim Hurst, who gained a position for him in the New England League, where he umpired from 1894 to 1897. In 1898 the NL brought him up to the majors, but he was offended by the league president''s reluctance to back up umpires'' decisions on the field, and resigned in the middle of the 1900 season, later signing with the fledgling AL in 1901. That league''s president, Ban Johnson, was eager to create a reputation for the AL as a solid challenger to the NL, and he gave umpires a greater measure of support than they had previously received, demonstrating that attacks upon umpires would not be tolerated and that their judgment was final. Connolly had the privilege of umpiring, by himself, the first American League game ever played on April 24, 1901.

Although he had begun his career by showing that he was willing to remove players from the field – he ejected 10 in his first season – he came to earn great respect from the players, and once went 10 full years without needing to throw one out of a game. He also showed an ability to stand firm against the toughest players in defense of the rules; on September 11, 1912, he called Ty Cobb out for stepping across home plate while batting, after Cobb had hit an RBI triple on the third pitch of an intentional walk. During the ensuing argument, Connolly was struck in the mouth by a bottle thrown by a spectator. His reputation earned him prominent game assignments, including the first AL games ever played at Comiskey Park, Shibe Park, Fenway Park, and Yankee Stadium. Connolly was also the sole AL umpire chosen to work in the first World Series in 1903.

In 1931, new AL president Will Harridge was concerned about widespread complaints that the quality of umpiring in the league had deteriorated, and Connolly retired from active field work to become the league''s first supervisor of umpires. Travelling throughout the league to work with other umpires and ensure that everyone''s work was meeting the same high standards, he remained in that post until 1954, and came to be known as the nation''s foremost expert on baseball rules.

In his career, Connolly worked in an AL-record 8 World Series: 1903, 1908 (even-numbered games), 1910, 1911, 1913, 1916, 1920 and 1924. He was also the home plate umpire for Addie Joss'' perfect game on October 2, 1908, one of four no-hitters in which he called balls and strikes. On May 4, 1928, he was the first base umpire for a remarkable game between the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Athletics, in which 12 players who would eventually be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame appeared. Leo Durocher, who would be elected as a manager, also played; both managers, Miller Huggins and Connie Mack, were eventually elected, as were Connolly and fellow umpire Bill McGowan.

Connolly was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953, one of the first two umpires (the NL''s Bill Klem was the other) named to that honor. Connolly and Klem are the only two umpires in history to have worked in five decades; Connolly''s record of 31 years umpiring American League games was broken by Larry Barnett in 1999.

He died at age 90 in Natick, Massachusetts.

Growing up in Carmel, Indiana, Tom graduated from Carmel High School in 1974 then followed his father''s footsteps and joined the U.S. Army. Three years later he attended Indiana University where he became a member of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. His first taste of show business came after being selected to participate as a model in the IU all campus "Little 500 Fashion Show". When the motion picture Breaking Away started to film on IU''s campus that summer, he obtained a small role as a fraternity jock and the acting bug hit him. He moved to Chicago and modeled/acted in numerous commercials until he decided to "go for it" and headed for Hollywood in 1981 to pursue his acting career. He enrolled in several acting classes and soon landed his first role on Dynasty as Joan Collins'' chauffeur. Tom continued to study and did several guest-starring and co-starring roles on TV shows and commercials. In 1988 Tom decided to pursue another dream he had - becoming a police officer like his grandfather (a Michigan motorcycle officer in the 1930s). He joined the Los Angeles Police Department and while there, they used his acting skills to film numerous LAPD training films. After working the LA Riots in 1992, Tom decided to leave the LAPD and join the Simi Valley Police Department where he became a motorcycle officer. He used his law enforcement experience to continue his acting, part time, and performed as a police officer in numerous TV shows, commercials and films. Tom recently retired as a full time police officer to devote all his time to his acting career. He also has been hired as a technical advisor, special abilities actor and does his own stunts. Early in 2006, Tom reunited with and married his college sweetheart, Marsha Dunfee and they are raising their blended teenage family of two boys and a girl in Thousand Oaks, California.

Franklin Edward Cover (November 20, 1928 – February 5, 2006) was an American actor best known for starring in the sitcom The Jeffersons. His character, Tom Willis, was half of one of the first interracial marriages to be seen on prime-time television.

Cover was born on November 20, 1928 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Britta (Schreck) and Franklin Held Cover. He graduated from John Marshall High School in 1947. Cover graduated from Denison University in 1951, and he received his MA in Theater in 1954 and MFA in Theater in 1955 both from Case Western Reserve University.

His career started on the stage acting in Henry IV, Part 1 and Hamlet. He also appeared in Forty Carats with Julie Harris. He made his television debut on Naked City and later appeared on The Jackie Gleason Show.

In 1965, he married Mary Bradford Stone.

His first starring role was on The Jeffersons as Tom Willis who was married to a black woman, Helen, played by Roxie Roker.

The sitcom ran from 1975 to 1985. He also appeared in The Stepford Wives in 1975, and played Hubert Humphrey in the 1982 TV movie A Woman Called Golda.

Following the end of The Jeffersons, Cover continued to make guest appearances on television shows as well as appearing in a supporting role in Wall Street (1987). In 1994, he appeared in the second episode of ER. His final television appearance was in an episode of Will & Grace (entitled "Object Of My Rejection") that aired on May 13, 1999.

Cover died at the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey, on February 5, 2006. He had been living at the home since December 2005 while recovering from a heart condition, and died of pneumonia.  He was survived by his wife; the former Mary Bradford Stone, two adult children; Susan and Bradford, and a grandson, Maxwell. His son, Bradford Cover, an actor who lives in New York City, has appeared on Law and Order, Broadway, and Off Broadway, and is a company member at The Pearl Theatre Company.

Peggy Stewart (born Margaret O''Rourke; June 5, 1923 - May 29, 2019) was an American film actress who starred mostly in B-movies during the 1930s and 1940s. Her sister, Patricia O''Rourke, was an Olympic swimmer, and was married to World War II hero and well known B-movie actor Wayne Morris.

Stewart''s career began when she was cast in the 1937 film Wells Fargo, alongside Joel McCrea. By the early 1940s she was on contract with Republic Pictures, starring regularly with Allan Lane, Sunset Carson, and Wild Bill Elliott. During that time she played in several episodes of Adventures of Red Ryder. She usually played the part of the tough heroine, rather than a passive girl needing to be saved. Along that time she married western actor Don Barry. From 1944 to 1951 she starred in thirty-five films, most of which were serials and westerns.

Growing up in poverty in Port Said, Sayed Badreya''s dreams of movie stardom looked as bleak as the prospect of peace in the Middle East. From the Six Day War in ''67 through the Yom Kippur War in ''73, his only escape from the world he knew was the movie theater, where films transported him to a magical land. But it was here that he determined he was destined to be a part of that magic.  After attending New York University film school, and then moving to Hollywood, Sayed first worked in the film industry as an assistant to actor/director Anthony Perkins, and then with director James Cameron on True Lies.  His mission - to make movies that told the Arabic- American story, since it had yet to be told - led to the creation of his own production company, Zoom In Focus. Under this banner, he directed and produced the documentary, Saving Egyptian Film Classics as well as The Interrogation, which won Best Creative Short Film at New York International Film Festival. He also produced and starred in Hesham Issawi''s short, T for Terrorist, which was awarded Best Short Film at the Boston International Film Festival and the San Francisco World Film Festival. In 2007, he played his first leading role in the English language motion picture American East, a film that he also co-wrote.  2008 was Sayed Badreya''s breakout year. He captivated audiences as Abu Bakaar, the villainous arms dealer who kidnaps Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in the summer''s blockbuster Iron Man. Also that year, Sayed played the comedic Palestinian cab driver opposite Adam Sandler in You Don''t Mess with the Zohan.  This summer, Sayed can be seen in Paramount Pictures'' feature film El traspatio aka Backyard, directed by Oscar-nominated Carlos Carrera in which he plays a serial killer opposite Ana de la Reguera. Sayed can also be seen this summer in Movie 43, where he plays opposite Halle Berry. Additional forthcoming films include The Three Stooges, his fifth film with the Farrelly brothers; The Dictator, playing Sascha Baron Cohen''s father as the original Dictator, and Just Like a Woman, with Oscar nominated director Rachid Bouchareb. Also, Sayed is going to a new frontier in the new video game Uncharted 3, playing Ramses the Great Pirate Captain.  Most recently he completed his second leading role in the New York independent feature, Cargo, about human traffickers, directed by Yan Vizinberg. And he just finished co-starring opposite Oscar-nominated actress Melissa Leo in film The Space Between, directed by Travis Fine.  Sayed has also worked as an actor, Arabic dialect coach, and Islamic technical advisor on Path to 9/11, a $40 million mini-series about the events leading up to 9/11 produced by ABC/Touchstone.  Sayed''s efforts to bring attention to Arab-Americans in the motion picture industry have received much coverage over the years on radio, television, and in major publications around the world, such as The New York Times, GQ, NPR, ABC''s "Politically Incorrect" with Bill Maher, BBC''s "Panorama," CNN, "Fox Report with Shepard Smith", The Hollywood Reporter and Egypt Today.', 'Port Said, Egypt', 1, '/wMpSb8QfErr5a0NBKWc2a3Zxj47.jpg'),

Born to a working-class Irish family in Birkenhead, he attended Blessed Edward Campion Secondary Modern School, in Claughton Village, Birkenhead, Cheshire (now Merseyside). O''Grady moved to London in the late-1970s, there working as a peripatetic care officer for Camden Council. It was here in 1978 that he developed his drag act, basing the character of Lily Savage upon traits found amongst female relatives. Touring northern England as part of drag mime duo, the Playgirls, he eventually went solo as a stand-up comedian. Performing as Savage for eight years at a South London gay pub, the Royal Vauxhall Tavern (RVT), he gained a popular following among the city''s gay community and used his character to speak out for LGBT rights. After being nominated for a 1992 Perrier Award, he attracted mainstream attention and made various television, radio, and theatrical appearances. As Savage, he presented morning chat show The Big Breakfast (1995–96), game show Blankety Blank (1997–2002) and comedy series Lily Live! (2000–01), earning various awards and becoming a well known public figure. Seeking to diversify his career away from Savage, O''Grady starred in BBC sitcom Eyes Down (2003–04) and presented two travel documentaries for ITV. In 2004, he began presenting ITV''s daytime chat show The Paul O''Grady Show, which proved a hit with audiences. After the network refused to transfer creative control of the series to O''Grady''s production company, Olga TV, in 2006 he defected to rival Channel 4, where the show was rebranded as The New Paul O''Grady Show and ran until 2009. O''Grady subsequently presented a late night ITV show, Paul O''Grady Live (2010–11) as well as Paul O''Grady: For the Love of Dogs (2012–present) and Paul O''Grady''s Animal Orphans (2014–2016), while presenting BBC Radio 2''s Paul O''Grady on the Wireless and publishing a four-volume autobiography.

He wasn''t a natural, instinctive talent but entertainer Ken Murray had solid breeding to rely on. Born in 1903 in New York City, his father was a vaudeville comic and Ken taught himself to dance, sing, tell jokes, and even perform rope tricks to try and get ahead. It paid off. Touring in an act with his first wife, Ken was soon headlining the Palace during the declining days of vaudeville. At first a hobby, Ken found another lucrative outlet when he went to Hollywood and bought a 16mm home movie camera to take shots of home and family. As his name around town increased, so did the quality of his subjects, which now included famous movie stars who mugged willingly for the camera. By the mid 1930s, his movies were being utilized by Columbia in a short subject series called "Screen Snapshots", clips that are still used today for documentaries and retrospects.

In 1942, Ken appeared as producer, star and overall ringleader of the stage show "Ken Murray''s Blackouts", a strange blend of risqué humor, well-proportioned young starlets, musical interludes and novelty acts that ran for many years. In fact, it set a record at the time for the longest running show in the history of Los Angeles (7 years, 3,844 performances). It became an absolute must-see during WWII.

He received a special Academy Award in 1947 for "novel and entertaining use of the medium". Ken hosted his own TV show, The Ken Murray Show (1950), between 1950 and 1953. He worked in Las Vegas showrooms as well in the 50s, managing a few acting roles on the side, notably The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). The showman with the distinct crew cut penned his autobiography "Life on a Pogo Stick" in 1960. In 1979 he edited his home movies into a film anthology called "Ken Murray''s Shooting Stars".

He had four children, two boys and two girls -- his son Cort was a professional singer at one time.

Ken died at age 85 in Burbank, California.

Not satisfied, Williams subsequently left NYU to focus on his acting career goals full time. After booking several national commercial and voice-over spots, he made his film debut opposite Kerry Washington in the critically acclaimed feature Lift. Several television appearances followed on shows such as Law &amp; Order: SVU and The Twilight Zone. In 2004, while recurring on Third Watch, Williams booked a role alongside Michael Madsen in the ESPN original series Tilt.

Page Kennedy (born November 23, 1976) is an American television and film actor who is currently starring in the sports comedy series Blue Mountain State on Spike.

Kennedy attended Western Michigan University where his talent was discovered. He soon transferred to the University of Delaware to major in theatre and acting. Kennedy soon moved to Los Angeles and began to guest star on several shows including Six Feet Under, Blind Justice, Barbershop, Love, Inc., NYPD Blue, The Shield, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation

In 2005, Kennedy won a recurring role on the popular ABC primetime soap, Desperate Housewives where he played Caleb Applewhite, a fugitive who was being held captive in his mother''s (Alfre Woodard) basement. However shortly after in November 2005, Kennedy was fired from Desperate Housewives; Kennedy himself claimed that Touchstone Television, the producers of the show, wanted to take a new direction with the character and bought out his contract. He was replaced by NaShawn Kearse. The producers indicated it was due to sexual misconduct, given his screen time at the time his contract was cancelled amounted to no more than a few seconds.

Kennedy joined the cast of Showtime''s hit series Weeds during its second and third season. He played the drug-dealer and self-described "thug", "U-Turn".

Kennedy played a gay inmate and gang leader in My Name is Earl and a married inmate and ex-con in Raising the Bar.

Kennedy also had an uncredited role in season six of the medical drama House, playing the son of a brutal African dictator.

Kennedy resides in Los Angeles.
