Jim Kammerud (born 1960) is an American director, writer, producer and animator, best known for his work with the Walt Disney Company.

Kammerud attended the Ohio State University in the mid-1980s. There he developed his cartooning style by working as an editorial cartoonist, as well as creating the comic strip "It''s Working," for The Lantern, the University''s student newspaper. Also on staff at The Lantern at the time was Jeff Smith, later known for the comic book Bone.

After college, while still living in Columbus, Ohio, Kammerud and Smith formed the Character Builders animation studio. There Kammerud began working on Rover Dangerfield and worked as an animator and storyboard artist for Bebe''s Kids as well as Space Jam. He became involved with Disney as sequence director for the additional animation in Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World and later joined to direct and design the new characters in The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. His next film as director was 101 Dalmatians II: Patch''s London Adventure, when he also worked on part of the screenplay. His second film where he worked on the screenplay was Tarzan II, in addition to producing the film, and his most recent project, The Fox and the Hound 2 is his first film without co-direction from Brian Smith. He also worked on The Aristocats II, which has since been shelved after the decision to drastically reduce the number of direct-to-video sequels made by Disney.

In 2009, Kammerud was featured in The Cartoonist, a documentary film on the life and work of Jeff Smith, creator of Bone.

Patrick Roach (born March 4, 1969) is a Canadian actor best known for playing the always shirtless and cheeseburger-addicted assistant trailer park supervisor Randy on the cult television series Trailer Park Boys.

Roach was born in Branch, a community in Newfoundland, but grew up in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

Randy works as deputy for park supervisor Mr. Lahey, with whom he shares a "relationship" in which among other things Lahey is largely dependent on his assistant for his daily functioning, care and nurturing. Roach has commented in an interview that Randy is gay, though the show portrays the character as bisexual. Mr. Lahey and Randy''s relationship is similar to that seen between Mr. Burns and Smithers on The Simpsons, only involving more petty crime, foul language, role-playing, drug abuse, and large amounts of alcohol.

For the first four years he appeared on Trailer Park Boys Roach continued to work as a regional sales manager for Sparkling Springs, a bottled water company. He would film Trailer Park Boys on his vacation time, but in July 2004 he quit his job (which he had held since 1993) in order to concentrate on acting, a decision he thought was risky, but worth it. While not shooting the show, he goes across the country with John Dunsworth (Lahey) at comedy clubs and other music events as a stand-up/improv act. He also appeared on a commercial for the telephone service "Vonage". When asked what it was like appearing shirtless in nearly every episode, Roach replied that "it was uncomfortable at first, but after everyone in Canada has seen you, what the hell."

He was also in the original Trailer Park Boys short film before it was made into a series. His character was the basis for Randy, but was named Patrick and wore a shirt.

He is married to Candyce, and together they have two children, Rebecca and Cody, who, because of their young ages (twelve and ten respectively, as of 2010), are forbidden to watch Trailer Park Boys.  He currently works at Investors Group in Halifax. In 2010, Roach reunited with many of his former Trailer Park Boys castmates in the new series The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Fun Time Hour.

Faith Renée Evans (born June 10, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actress and author. Born in Florida and raised in New Jersey, Evans relocated to Los Angeles during 1993 for a career with the music business. After working as a backing vocalist for Al B. Sure and Christopher Williams, she became the first female artist to be contracted with Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs'' Bad Boy Entertainment recording company during 1994, for which she released three platinum-certified studio albums between the years 1995 and 2001. During 2003, she ended her relationship with the company to contract with Capitol Records.

Other than her recording career, Evans is known as the widow of New York rapper Christopher "The Notorious B.I.G." Wallace, whom she married on August 4, 1994, a few weeks after meeting at a Bad Boy photoshoot. The turbulent marriage resulted in Evans'' involvement in the East Coast-West Coast hip hop feud, dominating the rap music news at the time, and ended with Wallace''s murder in a yet-unsolved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, California during March 1997. A 1997 tribute single featuring Puff Daddy and the band 112, named "I''ll Be Missing You", became Evans'' best-selling song to date and won her a Grammy Award during 1998.

Also an avocational actress and writer, Evans made her screen debut in the 2000 musical drama Turn It Up by Robert Adetuyi. Her autobiography Keep the Faith: A Memoir was released by Grand Central Publishing during 2008 and won a 2009 African American Literary Award for the Best Biography/Memoir category.

  Andy Whitfield (died 11 September 2011) was a Welsh-Australian actor and model. He was best known for his leading role in the Starz television series Spartacus: Blood and Sand during 2010.  

  Career  

  Whitfield was born in Amlwch, Anglesey, Wales. He studied engineering at the University of Sheffield, England and worked in Lidcombe, New South Wales, Australia as an engineer before settling in Sydney in 1999. He appeared in several Australian television series, such as Opening Up, All Saints, The Strip, Packed to the Rafters, and McLeod''s Daughters.  Whitfield gained his first prominent role in the Australian supernatural film Gabriel. He also starred in the 2010 television series Spartacus: Blood and Sand, which was filmed in New Zealand. He portrays a version of the historical Spartacus, although in this retelling he is a conscripted soldier condemned to death who defeats all four of his executioners and is thereby recycled as a gladiator. The actual Spartacus, like this fictional version, was destined to lead a rebellion against the Romans (the Third Servile War). Whitfield also appeared in the Australian thriller The Clinic starring opposite Tabrett Bethell (of Legend of the Seeker fame) which was shot in Deniliquin.  In August 2010, Whitfield teamed up with Freddie Wong and created a 2-minute YouTube video named "Time Crisis", based on the game Time Crisis. Whitfield made a brief, uncredited voice-only appearance in the prequel mini-series Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, which premiered on 21 January 2011.  

  Illness and death  

  In March 2010, Whitfield was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and began undergoing treatment immediately in New Zealand. This delayed production of season two of Spartacus: Vengeance. While waiting for Whitfield''s treatment and expected recovery, the network produced a six-part prequel, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, with only a brief uncredited voiceover from the actor. Although declared cancer-free, only two months later he suffered a recurrence of the disease later in the year and was ultimately compelled to abandon the role. Starz recast Australian actor Liam McIntyre as Whitfield''s successor.  Whitfield died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Sydney, Australia, on 11 September 2011, 18 months after his initial cancer diagnosis.', 'North Wales, UK', 1, '/1wZWDb8eYhGS3IxaWbVYjbqWrEG.jpg'),

He is working for WWE, signed to its SmackDown brand. Jacobs began his wrestling career in 1992 working on independent circuits. He wrestled in Smoky Mountain Wrestling as Unabomb where he won the SMW Tag Team Championship as a member of The Dynamic Duo, and in the United States Wrestling Association where he won the USWA Heavyweight Championship as Doomsday. He later joined his current promotion, the World Wrestling Federation (which later became World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002) in 1995, where he wrestled under various gimmicks before debuting as his current character, Kane, in 1997. Kane is the storyline half-brother of The Undertaker, with whom Kane has teamed up as the Brothers of Destruction.

Jacobs has accumulated 17 championship accolades during his WWE career. He is a three-time world champion, having won the WWF Championship once, the ECW Championship once, and the World Heavyweight Championship once (tied for third longest reign in history); making him the first person ever to hold all three WWE world titles. He is also a two-time WWF/E Intercontinental Champion, a one-time WWF Hardcore Champion, and an eleven-time Tag Team Champion; winning the WWE Tag Team Championship (once with The Big Show), the WCW World Tag Team Championship once (with The Undertaker), and the World Tag Team Champion nine times (twice with Mankind, X-Pac, and The Undertaker; and once with The Hurricane, Rob Van Dam, and The Big Show). Jacobs is the third Grand Slam Champion in WWE history. In addition to championships, he is a one-time Money in the Bank winner, also he has become the quickest man to cash in the briefcase. Kane currently holds several records in the Royal Rumble match. Most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble with 11, most Royal Rumble match appearances with 15, most consecutive appearances in the match with 13 from 1999 to 2011, and the quickest elimination of another competitor at 1.8 seconds. The Kane character was featured in the fourteen-issue Undertaker comic book produced by Chaos! Comics in 1999. The character only spoke once, in the Undertaker Halloween Special, which tied into the single issue Mankind comic book produced by the same company. A book written by Michael Chiappetta detailing the origins of Kane titled Journey into Darkness: An Unauthorized History of Kane was released in 2005. WWE released a three-disc anthology titled, The Twisted, Disturbed Life of Kane on December 9, 2008. The DVD consists of Kane''s greatest feuds and rivalries during his first ten years.

Jacobs hosted a podcast titled The Tiny Political Show under the pseudonym Citizen X from March 16, 2007 to March 13, 2008. Jacobs also ran a blog called The Adventures of Citizen X at AdventuresOfCitizenX.com from 2007 until July 17, 2011, though its last update was made on May 28 earlier that same year. However, the website has since been relaunched with its first update appearing on July 1, 2012.Jacobs is a contributor to LewRockwell.com.

He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew. In East Asia, it is common for people to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect.

As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu "brothers", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname "Dai Goh Dai", meaning, Big, Big Brother or Biggest Big Brother.

John Grinham Kerr (November 15, 1931 – February 2, 2013), was an American actor and lawyer.

He made his Broadway debut in 1953 in Mary Coyle Chase''s Bernardine, a high-school comedy for which he won a Theatre World Award. In 1953-54, he received critical acclaim as a troubled prep school student in Robert Anderson''s play Tea and Sympathy. In 1954, he won a Tony Award for his performance, and he starred in the film version in 1956.

Kerr''s first television acting role was in 1954 on NBC''s Justice as a basketball player who believes that gamblers have ruined his success on the court. His mother appeared with him on the series, which focuses on the cases of attorneys with the Legal Aid Society of New York.

He made The Cobweb for MGM, who liked his work so much they co-starred him with Leslie Caron in Gaby (1956), the third remake of Waterloo Bridge, which, in its original pre-Code 1931 version, featured John''s grandfather, actor Frederick Kerr.

Kerr starred with Deborah Kerr (no relation) in Tea and Sympathy in 1956.

In a widely publicized decision in 1956, Kerr declined to play the role of Charles Lindbergh in The Spirit of St. Louis because he did not respect Lindbergh''s early support of the Nazi regime in Germany prior to America''s entry into World War II. "I don''t admire the ideals of the hero", Mr. Kerr told The New York Post. The part went to James Stewart.

Kerr had a major role in the film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein''s South Pacific (1958), playing Lt. Joe Cable, the newly arrived marine about to be sent on a dangerous spy mission. In The Crowded Sky (1960), Kerr played a pilot who helps the Captain (Dana Andrews) steer a crippled airliner back to earth. Another film appearance was in Roger Corman''s The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). In 1963, Kerr had a continuing role on Arrest and Trial, playing Assistant DA Barry Pine.

During the 1960s, Kerr guest starred on several TV series including The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Rawhide, Gunsmoke and Adam-12. He had a regular role on the ABC-TV primetime TV series, Peyton Place, playing District Attorney John Fowler during the 1965-66 season. Also in 1964-65 he appeared as guest star on several episodes of Twelve O''Clock High.

In the 1970s, Kerr had a recurring role as prosecutor Gerald O''Brien on The Streets of San Francisco and he made guest appearances in several other TV programs including The Mod Squad, Columbo, McMillan and Wife, Barnaby Jones and The Feather and Father Gang. Kerr''s last acting appearance was a minor role in The Park Is Mine (1986), a made-for-TV movie starring Tommy Lee Jones.

Sam Pillsbury is an American film director and producer.

Connecticut-raised Sam Pillsbury emigrated to New Zealand at the age of 14. Aged 23, he began working at the Government-owned National Film Unit, joining a group of emerging filmmakers who were investigating new subjects and styles.

Pillsbury directed seven films at the National Film Unit, including a multi-faceted study of artist Ralph Hotere, and a satirical look at workplace relations (Men and Supermen). He was also part of the directing team on Commonwealth Games chronicle Games 74, and worked both on set and at the editing bench for Paul Maunder''s Gone Up North for a While.

Pillsbury went solo in 1975. Documentary Birth with R.D.Laing won awards on both sides of the Tasman, and controversy in England and the United States. The film featured controversial Scottish psychiatrist R.D. Laing critiqueing Western medical handling of childbirth. Pillsbury also worked on four documentaries for TV slot Seven Days, which variously looked into life for a solo mother, an ex-convict, hospital patients, and young Māori in the city.

More TV docos followed, then in 1978, Against the Lights, a short drama based on a Witi Ihimaera tale. Pillsbury''s Round the Bays doco The Greatest Run on Earth won awards at festivals in Chicago and Torino.

Pillsbury''s feature film debut in 1981 was with The Scarecrow, based on the gothic novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson. Presented through the eyes of two teenage boys, the film chronicles the arrival in a 50s town of a mysterious stranger (played by American movie legend John Carradine). In 1982 The Scarecrow became the first Kiwi film to win invitation to the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, in the non-competitive Director''s Fortnight section. Teen star Jono Smith later reinvented himself as a cinematographer in England.

Pillsbury then worked extensively on a screen adaptation of end of the world sci-fi novel The Quiet Earth, before handing the project to director Geoff Murphy after deciding it needed fresh eyes (he later joked at being one of the only directors who had fired himself). Instead Pillsbury helmed 1880s immigrant tale Heart of the High Country for TV (based on a novel by Elizabeth Gowans), then segued into period road movie Starlight Hotel, which starred Smash Palace discovery Greer Robson.

Since Starlight Hotel, Pillsbury has directed extensively, mainly on American tele-movies. He returned to Kiwi moviemaking in 2000 for Crooked Earth, the tale of a clash between two Māori: a militant drug-dealer, and former military man Temuera Morrison.

Pillsbury''s other features include Free Willy 3: The Rescue, 2008 road movie Endless Bummer and Knight Rider 2010.

These days Pillsbury has a second career as a winemaker. In 2000 he and a business partner sold Arizona wine company Dos Cabezas to a group headed by the lead singer for rock group Tool (band). Pillsbury Wine Company was launched soon afterwards.

Although born in Grand Forks, British Columbia, Canada, Dmytryk grew up in San Francisco when his Ukrainian parents moved to the United States. At the age of 31, he became a naturalized citizen.

His best known films from the pre-McCarthy period of his career were film noirs Crossfire, for which he received a Best Director Oscar nomination, and Murder, My Sweet, the latter an adaptation of Raymond Chandler''s Farewell My Lovely. In addition, he made two World War II films: Hitler''s Children, the story of the Hitler youth and Back to Bataan starring John Wayne.

The late 1940''s was the time of the Second Red Scare, and Dmytryk was one of many filmmakers investigated. Summoned to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he refused to cooperate and was sent to jail. After spending several months behind bars, Dmytryk made the decision to testify again, and give the names of his fellow members in the American Communist Party as the HUAC had demanded. On April 25, 1951, Dmytryk appeared before HUAC for the second time, answering all questions. He spoke of his own Party past, a very brief membership in 1945, including the naming of twenty-six former members of left-wing groups. He explained how John Howard Lawson, Adrian Scott, Albert Maltz and others had pressured him to include communist propaganda in his films. His testimony damaged several court cases that others of the so-called "Hollywood 10" had filed. He recounted his experiences of the period in his revealing 1996 book, Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten (Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, IL).

For a time, Dmytryk moved to England, and Stanley Kramer hired him to direct a trio of low-budget films before handing Dmytryk The Caine Mutiny. He made films for major studios Columbia, 20th Century Fox, MGM and Paramount Pictures, including, among others, Raintree County, The Left Hand of God, The Young Lions, a remake of the Marlene Dietrich classic The Blue Angel, and The Carpetbaggers. Later into the 60'' and 70''s, he directed Where Love Has Gone, Anzio, Alvarez Kelly, Shalako, and his final film Bluebeard. The films which he directed featured stars such as Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, Gene Tierney, Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda.

After his film career tapered off in the 1970s, he entered academia and taught at the University of Texas at Austin, and at the University of Southern California. He wrote several books on the art of filmmaking (such as "On Film Editing") and lectured at various colleges and theaters, such as the Orson Welles Cinema.

Dan Duryea (January 23, 1907, in White Plains, New York – June 7, 1968, in Hollywood, California) was an American actor of film, stage and television. Duryea graduated from Cornell University in 1928. While at Cornell, Duryea was elected into the Sphinx Head Society. He made his name on Broadway in the play Dead End, followed by The Little Foxes, in which he played the dishonest and not particularly bright weakling Leo Hubbard. He moved to Hollywood in 1940 to appear in the film version in the same role. He established himself in films playing similar secondary roles as the foil, usually as a weak or annoyingly immature character, in movies such as The Pride of the Yankees. As his career progressed throughout the 1940s he began to carve a niche as a violent, yet sexy, bad guy in a number of film noirs. In so doing he established a significant female following and, over time, something of a cult status. His work in this era included Scarlet Street, The Woman in the Window, Criss Cross, Black Angel and Too Late for Tears. From the 1950s, Duryea was more often seen in Westerns, most notably his charismatic villain in Winchester ''73 (1950). Other memorable work in the latter part of his career included Thunder Bay (1953), The Burglar (1957), The Flight of the Phoenix (1965), and the primetime soap opera Peyton Place. He also appeared in one of the first Twilight Zone episodes in 1959 as a drunken former gunfighter in "Mr. Denton on Doomsday," written by Rod Serling. He guest starred on NBC''s anthology series The Barbara Stanwyck Show. In 1963, Duryea appeared as Dr. Ben Lorrigan in the episode "Why Am I Grown So Cold" on the NBC medical drama about psychiatry, The Eleventh Hour. Duryea was far removed from many of the characters he played in the course of his career. He was married for thirty-five years to his wife, Helen, who preceded him in death on January 21, 1967. The couple had two sons: Peter, who worked for a time as an actor, and Richard. Dan Duryea died of cancer at the age of sixty-one. His remains are interred in Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

Leonard Gregory Kastle (11 February 1929 – May 18, 2011) was an opera composer, librettist, and director, though he is best known as the writer/director of The Honeymoon Killers, his only venture into the cinema, for which he did all his own research. He was educated at the Curtis Institute of Music studying under opera composer Gian Carlo Menotti and also the Juilliard School. He was an adjunct member of the SUNY Albany music faculty.

His operas include Deseret (1961), on a libretto by Anne Howard Bailey about Brigham Young, which he directed for the NBC Opera Theatre. He wrote in a Romantic style that he believed the music academy did not hold in high regard as something for contemporary composers to do. His favorite composer was Gustav Mahler, whom he believed was not at all respected when he was in music school.

In 1956, Kastle composed a thirteen-minute "made-to-measure" opera, titled The Swing, for two singers, a speaking part, and piano accompaniment. It was commissioned by and broadcast on the NBC television network on Sunday, June 10, 1956, at noon. He also wrote The Pariahs, about the sinking of the whaling ship Essex, a trilogy of operas about the Shakers known under the collective title The Passion of Mother Ann: A Sacred Festival Play, a children''s opera called Professor Lookalike and the Children, a piano concerto, sonatas for piano and violin, and three unproduced screenplays, Wedding at Cana, Change of Heart, and Shakespeare''s Dog. In a 2003 interview for the Criterion Collection, he said that no producer wanted Wedding at Cana, just another Honeymoon Killers, which he did not want to do.

After The Honeymoon Killers, Kastle returned to teaching and composing. After the Criterion release of the film, he was rediscovered by a new generation of cult film enthusiasts and occasionally attends film related events such as The Ed Wood Film Festival in 2007 where he served on the panel of judges.

Dopo una breve gavetta musicale, giunse ad un immediato successo in ambito regionale con il suo primo album, ''A storia mia (1976), pubblicato grazie a fondi familiari. L''album ebbe notorietà anche nelle altre regioni meridionali.

Si sposò in giovane età nel 1979 con Annamaria (con cui si era fidanzato ventenne quando lei aveva appena 13 anni) dalla quale ebbe due figli: Antonio e Vincenzo. In questo periodo cominciò anche a lavorare in teatro nelle cosiddette sceneggiate, tipica forma teatrale napoletana. Già nel 1980, al debutto, trovò subito il successo con "Esposito Teresa", tre atti e due quadri di Alberto Sciotti, tratta dalla sua stessa omonima canzone. Il successo fu confermato l''anno seguente da "''A discoteca", anch''essa di Alberto Sciotti e tratta da una sua canzone.

Nel 1981 debuttò nel cinema, con Celebrità. Nel 1982 Interpreta Tradimento e Giuramento in coppia con il grande Mario Merola. Si realizzò l''abbinamento disco e film con ''Nu jeans e ''na maglietta. Il film, di cui gli autori e produttori avevano aspettative molto basse, tenne testa negli incassi a Flashdance. Da questo momento cominciò il "fenomeno Nino D''Angelo".

Nel 1983 pubblica in successione due album che lo proiettano verso il successo nazionale: "Sotto ''e stelle" e "Forza campione" rafforzando la collaborazione nei testi con il paroliere Antonio Casaburi, già precedentemente presente negli album "Nu jeans e ''na maglietta" e "Le due facce di Nino D''Angelo" e con Antonio Casaburi nascono canzoni come: ''Na muntagna ''e Poesie-T''amo-Aggio scigliuto a tte-Compagna di Viaggio-Vedrai- Fra cinquant''anni- Racconto d''amore. Gli arrangiamenti sono curati da Franco Chiaravalle.

Nel 1985 raggiunse la Top Ten delle classifiche nazionali con l''album Eccomi qua, che creò le premesse per il suo debutto al Festival di Sanremo nel 1986, dove presentò Vai. Fu totalmente ignorato dai critici ma il suo album Cantautore fu uno dei più venduti tra quelli del festival. Il successo su vasta scala gli permise di ottenere il passaggio dalla casa discografica Vis Radio alla Dischi Ricordi, per la quale pubblicò, nell''autunno di quell''anno l''album Fotografando l''amore.

Elizabeth, who later became Betty, was enrolled in Clark''s Dancing School at the age of three. With her mother''s guidance, Betty studied ballet and tap dancing. At age 13, Betty and her mother set out for Hollywood with the hopes of stardom. Lillian lied about her daughter''s age, and Ruth landed several minor parts in films in 1930, such as Whoopee! (1930), New Movietone Follies of 1930 (1930), Happy Days (1929) and Let''s Go Places (1930). In 1932, she signed with RKO Radio Pictures. The bit parts continued for the next three years. Betty finally landed a substantial part in By Your Leave (1934). One of her big roles was in College Swing (1938). Unfortunately, the public did not seem to take notice. She was beginning to think she was a failure. The next year, she married former child star Jackie Coogan. His success boosted hers, but they divorced in 1940. When she landed the role of Glenda Crawford in Down Argentine Way (1940), the public finally took notice of this shining bright star. Stardom came through comedies such as Coney Island (1943) and Sweet Rosie O''Grady (1943). The public was enchanted with Betty. Her famous pin-up pose during World War II adorned barracks all around the world. With that pin-up and as the star of lavish musicals, Betty became the highest-paid star in Hollywood. After the war, her star continued to rise. In 1947, the United States Treasury Department noted that she was the highest paid star in America, earning about $300,000 a year - a phenomenal sum even by today''s standards. Later, 20th Century-Fox, who had her under contract, insured her legs with Lloyds of London for a million dollars. Betty continued to be popular until the mid-1950s, when musicals went into a decline. Her last film was How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955). She then concentrated on Broadway and nightclubs. In 1965, she divorced band leader Harry James, whom she had wed in 1943. Betty Grable died at age 56 of lung cancer on July 2, 1973 in Santa Monica, California. Her life was an active one, devoid of the scandals that plagued many stars in one way or another. In reality, she cared for her family and the family life more than stardom.

The follow-up album, The Button-Down Mind Strikes Again! was also a massive success, and both albums held the Billboard #1 and #2 spots simultaneously, a feat unequaled until the 1991 release of Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II by hard rock band Guns N'' Roses.

Newhart later went into acting, starring in two long-running and prize-winning situation comedies, first as psychologist Dr. Robert "Bob" Hartley on the 1970s sitcom The Bob Newhart Show and then as innkeeper Dick Loudon on the 1980s sitcom Newhart. He also had a third sitcom that was short-lived and initially successful but was soon canceled, named Bob. Newhart also appeared in film roles such as Major Major in Catch-22, and Papa Elf in Elf.

He is the founder of the popular label No Limit Records, which was relaunched as New No Limit Records through Koch Records after the label went bankrupt. He also founded two other labels: Guttar Music Entertainment &amp; Take A Stand Records. He has also recently founded No Limit Forever Records. He is also the founder and CEO of P. Miller Enterprises, an entertainment and financial conglomerate and Better Black Television. Miller gained fame in the late 90''s with the success of his group TRU &amp; his fifth album Ice Cream Man, which contained his first single "Mr. Ice Cream Man". In 1997, after the success of one his biggest singles to date, "Make ''Em Say Uhh!," went platinum, Miller grew farther in popularity. Then Miller released his second platinum album Ghetto D. Miller also starred in his own street film, mostly based on his life, I''m Bout It, which was very successful. Then In 1998, P. Miller released his most highly successful album to date MP Da Last Don. The album was also based on a film that Miller produced, which came out earlier that year with the same name. The album hit #1 on the Billboard Top 200 charts, selling over 400,000 copies in it''s first week. The album was certified 4x Platinum, with over four million copies sold, making it Miller''s best album of his career. In 1999, Miller released his eighth album, Only God Can Judge Me. It was not as successful as his last album, though it still managed to reach a gold certification. Miller also starred in the successful movie, I Got the Hook Up, with A.J. Johnson. In the 2000''s, as No Limit Records popularity was going down, Miller''s was also as well. So P. Miller decided it would be best to re-launch No Limit Records as New No Limit Records. On November 28, 2000, he released his ninth studio album, Ghetto Postage; it was less successful, selling 500,000 copies, compared to earlier releases; critics ravaging the album led to diminishing sales. In 2003, Miller starred in the highly successful film Lockdown. Then, in 2004, P. Miller released his eleventh album, Good Side, Bad Side it charted number 1 on the Independent Billboards &amp; managed to sell over 300,000 copies. Then on that same year Miller released his first independent album Living Legend: Certified D-Boy on his new founded label Guttar Music the album only sold 75,000 copies. In 2011 it is known that Miller is working on a new soundtrack with his managing artist Gucci Mane that the two are producing &amp; starring in entitled Get Money which will be produced by Drumma Boy.

He studied theatre at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and studied further at the Camberwell School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design. He began as a theatre director and playwright in the mid 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s his career moved between work for the theatre and making films for BBC Television, many of which were characterized by a gritty "kitchen sink realism" style. His well-known films include Life is Sweet (1990), the comedy-drama Career Girls (1997), the Gilbert and Sullivan biopic Topsy Turvy (1999), and the bleak working-class drama All or Nothing (2002). His most notable works are arguably Naked (1993) for which he won the Best Director Award at Cannes, the BAFTA-winning (and Oscar-nominated) Palme d''Or winner Secrets & Lies (1996) and Golden Lion winner Vera Drake (2004).

His films and stage plays, according to the critic Michael Coveney, "comprise a distinctive, homogenous body of work which stands comparison with anyone''s in the British theatre and cinema over the same period."  Coveney further noted Leigh''s role in helping to create stars – Liz Smith in Hard Labour, Alison Steadman in Abigail''s Party, Brenda Blethyn in Grown-Ups, Antony Sher in Goose-Pimples, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth in Meantime, Jane Horrocks in Life is Sweet, David Thewlis in Naked – and remarked that the list of actors who have worked with him over the years – including Sheila Kelley, Paul Jesson, Phil Daniels, Lindsay Duncan, Lesley Sharp, Kathy Burke, Stephen Rea, Eric Richard, Julie Walters – "comprises an impressive, almost representative, nucleus of outstanding British acting talent."  Ian Buruma, writing in the New York Review of Books in January 1994, noted: "It is hard to get on a London bus or listen to the people at the next table in a cafeteria without thinking of Mike Leigh. Like other wholly original artists, he has staked out his own territory. Leigh''s London is as distinctive as Fellini''s Rome or Ozu''s Tokyo."

Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.; January 17, 1942) is an American former boxer and three-time World Heavyweight Champion, who is widely considered one of the greatest heavyweight championship boxers of all time. As an amateur, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. After turning professional, he went on to become the first boxer to win the lineal heavyweight championship three times. Originally known as Cassius Clay, Ali changed his name after joining the Nation of Islam in 1964, subsequently converting to Islam in 1975. In 1967, Ali refused to be conscripted into the U.S. military, based on his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War. He was arrested and found guilty on draft evasion charges, stripped of his boxing title, and his boxing license was suspended. He was not imprisoned, but did not fight again for nearly four years while his appeal worked its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it was successful. Nicknamed "The Greatest", Ali was involved in several historic boxing matches. Notable among these are three with rival Joe Frazier and one with George Foreman, whom he beat by knockout to win the world heavyweight title for the second time. He suffered only five losses (four decisions and one TKO by retirement from the bout) with no draws in his career, while amassing 56 wins (37 knockouts and 19 decisions). Ali was well known for his unorthodox fighting style, which he described as "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee", and employing techniques such as the rope-a-dope. He was also known for his pre-match hype, where he would "trash talk" opponents on television and in person some time before the match, often with rhymes. These personality quips and idioms, along with an unorthodox fighting technique, made him a cultural icon. In later life, Ali developed Parkinson''s disease. In 1999, Ali was crowned "Sportsman of the Century" by Sports Illustrated and "Sports Personality of the Century" by the BBC.

He later became the oldest man ever to become heavyweight boxing champion of the world when at age 45, he knocked out (KO-10) Michael Moorer, age 26, on November 5, 1994 to reclaim the title he held more than 20 years earlier. He has been named one of the 25 greatest fighters of all time by Ring magazine. He is now a successful businessman and an ordained Christian minister who has his own church.

Sir John Selby Clements, CBE (25 April 1910 – 6 April 1988) was an English actor and producer who worked in theatre, television and film.

Clements attended St Paul''s School and St John''s College, Cambridge University then worked with Nigel Playfair and afterwards spent a few years in Ben Greet''s Shakespearean Company. He made his first stage appearance in 1930. Clements founded the Intimate Theatre at Palmers Green in 1935, which is a combined repertory and try-out theatre. He appeared in almost 200 plays, and presented a number of plays in the West End as actor-manager-producer. He also started his film work in 1933. Clements was the artistic director of the Chichester Festival Theatre from 1966 to 1973.

He married the actress Kay Hammond and together they became a critical success on stage with their West End revival of Noel Coward''s play Private Lives in 1945. In 1952 they both appeared in Clements'' own play The Happy Marriage, an adaptation of Jean-Bernard Luc''s Le Complexe de Philemon. Clements starred as Edward Moutlon Barrett in the musical Robert and Elizabeth, a successful adaptation of The Barretts of Wimpole Street. His stepson is the actor John Standing.

As a film actor John Clements came to prominence when the film director Victor Saville chose him to star opposite Ralph Richardson in South Riding (1938). The two actors were reunited in the very successful The Four Feathers (1939). After this Clements'' film career was somewhat intermittent although he made a series of British war films for Ealing Studios and British Aviation Pictures, such as Convoy (1940), Ships with Wings (1942), Tomorrow We Live (1943), and as Yugoslav guerrilla leader Milosh Petrovitch in Undercover (1943). He had a cameo role (as Advocate General) in Gandhi (1982).

Clements was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 1956 and knighted in 1968.

Kristian Levring is a Danish director born in 1957 in Denmark. He was the fourth signatory of Dogme95. He lived eight years in France. He graduated in editing at the National Film School of Denmark and has edited a large number of documentaries and feature films besides directing two feature films, among these, Et skud fra hjertet (1986). He is the recipient of some 23 Danish and international awards for his commercials. The King is Alive (Dogme 4) is his third feature film. The King is Alive tells the story of a mixed group of tourists in Namibia, Africa, whose bus breaks down in a remote, abandoned village (formerly a mining town). Facing starvation, dehydration, cabin fever, and death, one of the group decides to stage a production of Shakespeare''s King Lear and casts the others as characters. As the thin veneer of civilized behavior breaks down, the group experiences the absurdity of putting on a play (for no audience except one lone indigenous man) in such dire and fatal circumstances. Filmed in stark digital and adhering to the tenets of Dogme filmmaking, The King is Alive is a fascinating study in the dark heart of people under extreme stress. Herzogian in its theme and mood, the film''s location (remote Namibia) is as much a character in the film as the actors, like the space ship in Ridley Scott''s Alien. The King is Alive features Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Brion James (Blade Runner''s "Leon"; Cabin Boy). Dark, tense, and desperate, it stands as a powerful piece of filmmaking. Levring''s next film after The King is Alive is called The Intended and features some of the same actors from the former. Set in the jungle of Borneo in the 1920s, it concerns an isolated English settlement/ivory trading station. Similar in nature to The King is Alive, it focuses on what happens to small isolated groups under both internal psychological pressure and external pressure from the environment around them. As The King is Alive was filmed by Dogme rules and restrictions, The Intended instead has steady camera shots (rather than shaky/handheld) and ambient music throughout. Subtle yet powerful, the film explores Conradian contexts through the lens of a female perspective. Its influence can be seen in the Australian frontier film The Proposition.

She is one of three sisters, along with Miriam and the late Beverly (December 21, 1921 – June 2, 1998).

She graduated from Shorewood High School in 1944. For the first ten years or so of her life, Rae''s family lived in Milwaukee, then moved to Shorewood, Wisconsin. She did radio work and was with the Wauwatosa Children''s Theatre. At 16, she was an apprentice with the Port Players, a professional theater company that came for the summer to Milwaukee, with several established actors such as Morton DaCosta, who would eventually direct The Music Man on Broadway.

Rae attended Northwestern University, although she did not complete her studies, where she met Cloris Leachman, who many years later succeeded Rae on The Facts of Life for the show''s last two seasons. At Northwestern she met several unknown stars and producers, including Agnes Nixon, Charlton Heston, Paul Lynde, Gerald Freedman, Claude Akins and songwriter Sheldon Harnick. When a radio personality told her that her last name wouldn''t do, she dropped it, to her father''s chagrin. She moved to New York City in 1948, where she performed in the theater and nightclubs. During her early years in New York, she worked at the Village Vanguard (alongside up-and-coming talents such as singer Richard Dyer-Bennet) and at the posh Blue Angel, home to budding talents Barbra Streisand, Mike Nichols and Elaine May.

Sonny Tufts (born Bowen Charlton Tufts III, July 16, 1911, Boston, Massachusetts - June 4, 1970, Santa Monica, California) was a United States film actor.

Tufts was born into a prominent banking family, whose patriarch had supposedly sailed to America from England in 1683. He broke with the family banking tradition by studying opera at Yale, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. After graduating from college in 1935, he auditioned with the Metropolitan Opera in New York but eventually worked on the Broadway stage. In 1942, Tufts went to Hollywood. He attained some fame during World War II, principally because, due to an old college football injury, he was one of the few handsome male actors not serving overseas in the war.

He was married to Spanish dancer Barbara Dare from 1938 to 1953.

In the 1980s he was best known as one of the semi-random people and places that TV host Johnny Carson used in his jokes.

Tufts died of pneumonia at age 58 in Santa Monica, California, on June 4, 1970.

Tufts is the subject of an urban legend. The legend holds that he had been selected to host a well-known radio show as a last-minute replacement for a better known celebrity. The week before Tufts''s episode was scheduled, the previous host introduced him with a combination of surprise and outrage, shocked that a relatively unknown actor would succeed him as host. There is no evidence, however, that such an incident occurred. Tufts himself parodied this legend in frequent appearances on Rowan &amp; Martin''s Laugh-In: seated in a director''s chair with his name printed on it, he would turn around to face the camera and utter a word or phrase relevant to the previous bit, in mock contempt.

Sonny Tufts was related to Charles Tufts, for whom Tufts University is named.

In a non sequitur on the cartoon show Rocky and His Friends, in the Jet Fuel Formula story arc, Bullwinkle J. Moose becomes very upset when Boris Badenov steals his autographed picture of Sonny Tufts.

Also, Tufts is mentioned in the last sentence of the third sketch of the 48th show of the second season of the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show (also featuring Wailing Whale episodes 5 &amp; 6), which was first released on May 13, 1961.

In an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, Rob sees a flying saucer that makes a noise "Uhny Uftz", which Rob mis-hears as "Sonny Tufts"

In Episode 12, Season 1 of the TV sitcom "My Mother The Car", titled "And Leave The Drive-In To Us," the mother wants to go to a drive-in to see Sonny Tufts for her birthday. He makes an appearance at the very end of the episode, much to the appreciation of the car!

Sonny Tufts was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter).

Charles B. Pierce (June 16, 1938 – March 5, 2010) was an American film director, screenwriter, producer, set decorator, cinematographer and actor, and is considered one of the first independent filmmakers. Pierce directed thirteen films over the span of 26 years, but is best known for his cult hits The Legend of Boggy Creek (1973) and The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976).

Pierce was born in Hammond, Indiana, but moved to Arkansas early in his childhood. After working in production jobs at television stations, Pierce moved to Texarkana and started an advertising agency. He made his directorial debut with The Legend of Boggy Creek, a faux documentary-style film inspired by the legend of the Bigfoot-like Fouke Monster. The film was funded largely by a donation from an advertising client, and Pierce rented a local movie theater to exhibit it. The low-budget film grossed roughly $25 million.

Pierce followed the success with several inexpensive, regional films set in Southeastern and Southwestern United States. Among them were The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on the true story of the Phantom Killer murders in Texarkana. Pierce continued directing films into the 1980s, when he wrote the story for the Clint Eastwood film Sudden Impact (1983). For that screenplay, he is said to have written the phrase, "Go ahead, make my day," which became one of the most famous movie quotes in history.

After years of pressure from producers, Pierce directed a Boggy Creek sequel, Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues (1985), which he considered the worst film of his career. The sequel was featured in a 1999 episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000, which ultimately increased Pierce''s visibility. Pierce died of natural causes in Dover, Tennessee. His work has been cited as an influence on the horror film The Blair Witch Project (1999).

She made her recording debut in 1990 under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, and became the first recording artist to have her first five singles top the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993, a series of hit records including "Dreamlover", "Hero" and "Without You" from the diamond album Music Box established her position as Columbia Records'' highest-selling act.

Following her separation from Mottola in 1997, she introduced elements of hip hop into her album work, to much initial success, but when she left Columbia in 2001 her popularity was in decline. She signed an unprecedented $100 million deal with Virgin Records, only to be dropped from the label and bought out of her contract in the following year. This radical turn of events was due to the highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown, as well as the poor reception that was given to Glitter, her film and soundtrack project. In 2002 Carey signed a $24 million deal with Island Records, and after a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of pop music in 2005 with her album The Emancipation of Mimi. The album became the best-selling album of the 2000s decade and its single, "We Belong Together," became her most successful solo single of her music career and was also awarded Song of the Decade by Billboard.

In a career spanning over two decades, Carey has sold more than 200 million albums, singles, and videos worldwide, according to Island Def Jam, which makes her one of the world''s best-selling music artists. Carey was cited as the world’s best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards in 1998, and was named the best-selling female artist of the millennium by the same awards show in 2000. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the third-best-selling female artist, with shipments of 63 million albums in the U.S. In 2006 Carey was listed in 6th place on the Forbes Richest 20 Woman In Entertainment list. In April 2008, "Touch My Body" became Carey''s eighteenth number one single on the Hot 100, the most by any solo artist. Carey was included in Time magazine''s 100 Most Influential People in the world in 2008. Carey starred in the film Precious (2009), which earned her a Breakthrough Performance Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and an NAACP Image Award nomination.

Aside from her commercial accomplishments, she composes all her own material, has earned five Grammy Awards, seventeen World Music Awards, and is known for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register.

After completing high school she attended the University of Nevada and graduated with a double major in theater and communications broadcasting. From there she attempted a mainstream acting career under the name Kim McKamy and landed starring roles in a string of low-budget B horror films like Dreamaniac (1986) and Lunch Meat (1987). In direct opposition to her later career trajectory, she backed out of doing a nude scene in Creepozoids (1987) while on set and insisted on a body double for a shower scene in Evil Laugh (1986). But by 1989 she was appearing in nude pictorials in Penthouse and other men''s magazines that left nothing to the imagination.

In September 1990, Ashlyn starred in The Last Resort, the first of around 100 X-rated films she''d make over the next decade on her way to becoming one of the most popular porn stars of the era. In between those movies (some of which she wrote herself) she was pulling double duty as a mainstream actress, often completely under the radar and usually using different names. She was featured in the mainstream thriller Fatal Instinct (1992) and was a body double for Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct (1992) and for Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal (1993). She could be regularly seen on TV, whether on episodes of The X Files, Silk Stalkings or Millennium, or her recurring role as robot Feliciti OH on Fox''s Space Above and Beyond. Using the name "Kimberly Patton" she also had supporting roles in the Jet Li sci-fi / action film The One (2001) and the horror remake Willard (2003). Most of these were produced by Glen Morgan.

After a most interesting career and claiming no regrets in interviews, Ashlyn retired for good in the early 2000s. She now lives in Texas with her husband and works as a real estate agent.', 'Cherry Point, North Carolina, USA', 3, '/2lAlDSwHcXU8sJeObxEdHj3hEz6.jpg'),

Vivean Gray  (born Jean Vivra Gray on 20 July 1924 in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire) is an English actress, who found her niche playing gossipy characters in Australian television series. In her early life, she lived in England but moved to Australia after she had trouble finding any acting opportunities. She portrayed mathematics teacher Miss McGraw in Peter Weir''s film adaptation of Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975).

She played two long-running characters in Australian soap operas, Mrs Ida Jessup in The Sullivans for its entire run, and Mrs Nell Mangel in Neighbours.

She appeared in Prisoner as genteel poisoner Edna Pearson in 1984. After the initial showing of her episodes in Australia, a woman claimed the story was based on her real life experience of being accused of poisoning her husband and threatened to sue the producers,Grundy Television. As a result any material that coincided with the woman''s story was removed for subsequent episode screenings,including the full Australian DVD release of Prisoner. In 2010 a special DVD release of the full uncut ''Edna'' story was released but only in the UK.

Gray left her role of Mrs Mangel after receiving abuse from Neighbours fans who could not distinguish fact from fiction. In the story Mrs Mangel moved to St Albans, England.

Gray returned to England, and has since retired and leads a very private life.

She began acting in school plays when she was 5 years old. In college, she participated in plays and acting workshops, and continued her acting education through graduate school. She has also trained in voice acting and singing. Her first anime job came when her acting coach recommended her to the director. 4Kids Entertainment then discovered her and recruited her. Since then, she has been among the better known and more popular voice actors.  Her most famous roles include Ash Ketchum, Delia Ketchum (Ash''s mother), and May in the Pokémon anime meta series, April O''Neil from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun in the Slayers TV series, and the voice of Nico Robin in the 4Kids dub of One Piece.

Eric Stuart (born October 18, 1967 in Brooklyn, New York) is a voice actor, voice director, singer, songwriter, and guitarist. As the lead singer of his own band, the Eric Stuart Band (abbreviated ESB), he is an award-winning independent artist with a growing US and international fan base.

Stuart gained acclaim as a voice actor not only because of his performing ability, but also due to his remarkable skill in matching Japanese "lip flap," which makes him exceptionally qualified for English dubbed anime. Among his many roles, he is most well known as the voice of Brock and James in Pokémon (the first 10 years, seasons 1-8), as Seto Kaiba in Yu-Gi-Oh!, and as Gourry Gabriev in Slayers. His voice acting excellence has also earned him the job of voice directing, often while playing one or more characters on the same show.

Although he is an exceptionally skilled voice actor, Stuart is first and foremost a musician, and loves to perform on stage with his band—the Eric Stuart Band (ESB). He has toured with Peter Frampton (1999, 2000), Ringo Starr (1997), and Lynyrd Skynyrd (1997); and has opened for Jethro Tull (1997), Julian Cope (1995), Hall and Oates (1997, 1998), and Chicago (1995, 1997, 1998) as well. He has been influenced by many artists (Buddy Holly, Bruce Springsteen, Cat Stevens, Elvis, Neil Diamond, Jim Croce, and the Beatles), but his own musical style does not conform to any specific genre (usually in the vicinity of roots rock, folk, and country). Each of his albums has its own feel to it, but trademark features common to all include his unique ability to convey varied emotions with his voice, story-telling lyrics filled with rhetorical devices (clever and witty enough to stand on their own as poetry), and a meticulous attention to quality and minute detail in every note. Stuart coins the term "Concrete Country" to describe his music—for this reason, some ESB fans jokingly but loyally refer to themselves as "ConcreteBlockHeads" (or "blockheads" for short). His band has made seven albums to date, five of which are presently available worldwide: "Blue, Dressed In Black" (2000), "BombShellShocked" (2003),"In The County Of Kings" (2007),"Empty Frame of Reference" (2009). and Falls On Me (2011)

Forsyth first came to attention with a low-budget film, That Sinking Feeling, made with youth theatre actors and featuring a cameo appearance by the Edinburgh gallery owner Richard Demarco. The relative success of the film was carried to a far higher level by his next film Gregory''s Girl in 1981. This featured some of the same young actors, in particular John Gordon Sinclair, as well as the acting debut of Clare Grogan. The film was a major hit and won ''Best Screenplay'' in that year''s BAFTA Awards. In 1983 he wrote and directed the successful Local Hero, produced by David Puttnam, and featuring Burt Lancaster. It was rated in the top 100 films of the 1980s in a Premiere magazine recap of the decade. Forsyth''s next film was the 1984 Comfort and Joy, about a Glasgow radio DJ caught between rival ice cream companies, which again featured Clare Grogan. When Puttnam went to Hollywood, Forsyth followed, but had limited success. The 1987 Housekeeping was his first American film. Another movie, Being Human, was shelved by the studio for four years after Puttnam was ousted. Gregory''s Two Girls from 2000 appeared as a sequel to Gregory''s Girl, with John Gordon Sinclair playing the same character, but it received mixed reviews. In a June 2009 interview on BBC Radio 5 Live, Forsyth stated that he is currently working on a new film project with the working title of Exile.

Theresa Lee "Terry" Farrell (born November 19, 1963, height 5'' 11¾" (1,82 m)) is an American former actress and fashion model. She is perhaps best known for her performances in the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as Jadzia Dax and Becker as Regina Kostas.

Farrell is the daughter of Kay Carol Christine (Bendickson) and Edwin Francis Farrell, Jr. Later, her mother married David W. Grussendorf, who adopted Terry and her sister, Christine. In 1978, she left her hometown for a summer in Mexico City as a foreign exchange student. She has since been fond of big cities, so in her junior year of high school, the nearly six feet tall Farrell submitted her image to the Elite modeling agency in New York City. Shortly after, at the age of 16, she was summoned to New York City and, within two days of arriving, had an exclusive contract with Mademoiselle.

After 18 months of modeling, she studied acting with Kate McGregor Stewart while still modeling on the side. Her first major roles were in the short-lived 1983 television series Paper Dolls playing a model and in the feature film Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield. In the spring of 1989, she began studying acting with Stella Adler and appeared in a number of guest-starring roles in series like Quantum Leap and The Cosby Show. In 1992, she played Cat in a second pilot for a U.S. version of Red Dwarf, which was not picked up.

Soon after the Red Dwarf USA project folded, she was offered a lead role in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Farrell starred as Jadzia Dax, the space station''s Starfleet science officer; a character from an alien species known as the Trill, who is host to a 300-year-old symbiont and can draw upon the memories and knowledge of the symbiont''s seven previous hosts. The series debuted in January 1993. When she decided to leave the show at the end of the sixth season, Paramount killed Farrell''s "host" character (though continuing the "symbiont" character in a new Dax host, played by Nicole DeBoer).

Farrell then co-starred on Paramount''s television comedy series Becker. She played Regina "Reggie" Kostas, foil and love interest to Ted Danson''s John Becker, for four years and 94 episodes, before she was replaced by Nancy Travis.

Farrell also provided the voice of Six of One in the animated short film Tripping the Rift, which eventually became a Sci-Fi Channel TV series with other actors providing the voice of Six. First released independently on the Internet, Tripping the Rift originally featured Patricia Beckmann as the voice of Six and was replaced by Farrell''s voice for an episode of the Sci-Fi Channel''s short film series Exposure, in which Farrell was guest host. Farrell''s version of Six was heard only once on television.The asteroid 26734 Terryfarrell, discovered in 2001, was named in her honor by its discoverer, William Kwong Yu Yeung.Farrell lives in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with her husband, former Sprint Corporation spokesman Brian Baker (a.k.a. the Sprint Guy) and their son.

Born in Charlotte, North Carolina and raised in Virginia Beach and Miami Beach, Chyler began her career in front of the camera at age 12 modeling for magazines and catalogues. Her success in print later led to national commercials for Coca Cola and Wendy''s, among others.

By age 16, she had already completed several pilots (ABC''s Wilder Days (2000) and the WB''s Saving Graces (1999)) at the onset. Aaron Spelling confirmed the young actress''s talent when he hired her a few years ago as a series regular in the WB series Safe Harbor (1999) after seeing her performance on Saving Graces (1999). She also guest-starred on 7th Heaven (1996) in a powerful three-story arc wherein her character, "Frankie", a young, inept mother had adversely influenced the family.

Leigh made her film debut in the Colombia/Tri-Star hit comedy spoof Not Another Teen Movie (2001), which opened nationwide December, 2001. She originally auditioned for a smaller role, but the producers and directors were so impressed with her performance that they invited her to read for the lead. Leigh was stunned by her good fortune.

By January of 2002, Leigh had already landed a series role on the Fox comedy That ''80s Show (2002) (from the producers of "That ''70s Show"). The mid season comedy series portrayed Leigh as a rebellious teenager on the Fox Network. After the short-lived run, the series was canceled, and Leigh was immediately brought to executive producer David E. Kelley for consideration in his new Fox series Girls Club (2002). Three days later, Leigh was flown for the New York up-fronts where she was introduced as one of the new series leads, "Sarah Mickle", a young attorney, on Fox''s 2002 Girls Club (2002).

After only two episodes of Girls Club (2002) had aired, Leigh received a personal phone call from Kelley informing her of the show''s cancellation and his desire to bring her forward to his already established series The Practice (1997). With only a matter of weeks between shows, Leigh was at work on the set of ABC''s The Practice (1997) as "Claire Wyatt", a new Series Regular for the 2002-2003 season. In 2004, Leigh was reunited with Fox for their new half hour comedy pilot "Lucky Us". Chyler landed the starring role of the free-wheeling conservative young architect, "Lucy Reed". Weeks later, Leigh made a guest starring appearance as "Kate Spangler", a feisty young ad exec, in Fox''s new drama series North Shore (2004)".

Later in the season, Leigh took a brief break from Fox to shoot a series lead role opposite Billy Campbell in the WB''s drama pilot Rocky Point (2005). The series was centered on a young woman (Leigh) living on Hawaii''s North Shore who takes in her estranged father (Campbell).', 'Charlotte, North Carolina, USA', 2, '/nVE6gMC5x6NhM9ALt0N3FPwt5c9.jpg'),

A yearning for home – and at the same time, the allure of greater freedom. The good, the bad and the ugly about a crazy little thing called love."

As of 2001 Diamond has sold 115 million records worldwide, including 48 million records in the U.S. In terms of Billboard chart success, he is the third most successful Adult Contemporary artist ever, ranking behind only Barbra Streisand and Elton John.

Though his record sales declined somewhat after the 1980s, Diamond continues to tour successfully, and maintains a very loyal following. Diamond''s songs have been recorded by a vast array of performers from many different musical genres.

Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984, and in 2000 he received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award.

Imogene Fernandez de Coca (November 18, 1908 – June 2, 2001) was an American comic actress best known for her role opposite Sid Caesar on Your Show of Shows.

Starting out in vaudeville as a child acrobat, she studied ballet and wished to have a serious career in music and dance, graduating to decades of stage musical revues, cabaret and summer stock. Finally in her 40s she began a celebrated career as a comedienne in television, starring in six series and guesting on successful television programs from the 1940s to the 1990s.

She was nominated for five Emmy awards for Your Show of Shows, winning Best Actress in 1951 and singled out for a Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting in 1953. Coca was also nominated for a Tony Award in 1978 for On the Twentieth Century and received a sixth Emmy nomination at the age of 80 for an episode of Moonlighting.

She possessed a rubbery face capable of the broadest expressions—Life magazine compared her to Beatrice Lillie and Charlie Chaplin, and described her characterizations as taking "people or situations suspended in their own precarious balance between dignity and absurdity, and push(ing) them over the cliff with one single, pointed gesture"—the magazine noted a "particularly high-brow critic" as observing, "The trouble with most comedians who try to do satire is that they are essentially brash, noisy and indelicate people who have to use a sledge hammer to smash a butterfly. Miss Coca, on the other hand, is the timid woman who, when aroused, can beat a tiger to death with a feather."

In addition to vaudeville, cabaret, theater and television, she appeared in film, voiced children''s cartoons and was even featured in an MTV video by a New Wave band. Though her fame began late, she worked well into her 80s. Twice a widow, Coca died in 2001.

He became a star after he was discovered working as a Tokyo shop clerk by filmmaker Masaki Kobayashi during the early 1950s. He became the favorite leading man of internationally-acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa after a well publicized fallout between Kurosawa and the legendary Toshirō Mifune. Beginning in the late 1950s, he worked with a number of Japan''s best-known filmmakers, starring or co-starring in five Kurosawa films, along with significant films made by Hiroshi Teshigahara (The Face of Another), Mikio Naruse (When a Woman Ascends the Stairs), Kihachi Okamoto (Kill! and Sword of Doom), Hideo Gosha (Goyokin), Shiro Toyoda (Portrait of Hell) and Kon Ichikawa (Enjo and Odd Obsession). Notably, his long-term collaboration with Masaki Kobayashi invites comparison to the working relationship between Akira Kurosawa and Toshirō Mifune. Nakadai was featured in 11 Kobayashi films including the The Human Condition trilogy, Harakiri, Samurai Rebellion and Kwaidan. The Thick-Walled Room marked Nakadai''s acting debut. His next role was a little noticed and uncredited one in Akira Kurosawa''s Seven Samurai where he appears for a few seconds as a samurai wandering about town.

Patricia Owens (17 January 1925, Golden, British Columbia - 31 August 2000, Lancaster, California) was a Canadian-born American actress, working in Hollywood. She appeared in about 40 films and 10 TV episodes in a career lasting from 1943 to 1968.

Canadian-born actress Patricia Owens moved to England with her parents in 1933, and ten years later, at age 18, she made her motion-picture debut in Val Guest''s musical comedy Miss London Ltd. The following year, she had a small role in Harold French''s social satire English Without Tears. Her career continued in this manner for the next few years, Owens getting ever-larger roles in generally better movies (though not always—the same year in which she worked in the Launder-Gilliat production of The Happiest Days of Your Life, one of the funniest movies ever made in England, she also appeared in the abysmal Old Mother Riley, Headmistress).

Her career took a giant step upward when she was seen by a 20th Century Fox executive while performing in a theatrical production of Sabrina Fair and was offered a screen test. The result was a contract with the studio and a move to Hollywood. Her first American film was Island in the Sun (1957) for Fox, and then Owens was loaned out to Warner Bros. to play opposite Marlon Brando in the drama Sayonara (1957), one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year. Owens spent the rest of 1957 working mostly on loan-out, but it was a 1958 Fox production that secured her place in motion picture history—as Helene Delambre, the wife of scientist Andre Delambre in The Fly (1958), co-starring with David Hedison and Vincent Price. Owens carried much of the film''s story and drama, which were told in flashback from her character''s point-of-view. The Fly was one of the most successful science fiction movies of the decade; the image of Owens unmasking her stricken husband and screaming at what she sees—and the shot of her horrified visage seen in a "fly''s eye" view—became one of the defining moments in the genre.

Unfortunately for Owens, she never got another movie half as good as The Fly, from Fox or anyone else, and in 1961 was reduced to working in the threadbare, backlot POW/jungle chase drama Seven Women from Hell. Owens made occasional television appearances, on series such as Perry Mason and Burke''s Law, but these were relatively infrequent. Owens also starred in one of the 17 episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents directed by Hitchcock himself, "The Crystal Trench" (1959). By 1965, she was working in Black Spurs, one of producer A.C. Lyles'' B-Westerns, renowned for their use of aging genre stars, and Owens retired from movies after portraying Richard Egan''s love interest in the low-budget espionage thriller The Destructors (1968). Her last professional appearance was in a 1968 episode of Lassie.

She was the third wife of screenwriter and producer Sy Bartlett.

William ''Bill'' Kerr (born 1922) is an Australian film and television actor. He was born into a performing arts family in Cape Town, South Africa, but grew up in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia.

He began working as a child actor in depression era Australia, taking his first major role in The Silence of Dean Maitland, one of Australia''s first talking films.

After serving in the Second World War, Kerr moved to England to further his acting career, and during the 1940s he was regularly featured in the BBC radio series Variety Bandbox. His trademark was his catch phrase "I''m only here for 4 minutes..."

In the 1950s, he had a recurring role as an Australian lodger in the BBC radio comedy series Hancock''s Half Hour. Initially sharper than Hancock''s characterisation, it was developed into a more dim-witted character who became the butt of Hancock''s jokes. His television appearances in Britain include a 1968 Doctor Who story called The Enemy of the World, with Patrick Troughton, and a long running part in the early 1960s BBC-TV soap, Compact.

Bill Kerr had much theatrical success in Britain, playing The Devil in the original West End production of Damn Yankees, directed by Bob Fosse, and Cole. He also worked with Spike Milligan. He appeared in Milligan and John Antrobus''s stage play The Bed-Sitting Room, which opened at the Mermaid Theatre on 31 January 1963. A subsequent production opened on 3 May 1967 at the Saville Theatre, and "a cast containing an unusually high proportion of Australian actors including Bill Kerr and David Nettheim." Then in 1972 he co-starred with Anthony Newley in the long running Newley/Bricusse musical, The Good Old Bad Old Days. In 1975, Kerr took the part of Bluey Notts, described as "an Australian bookie''s clerk, a crude racialist", in The Melting Pot. This was a sitcom written by Spike Milligan and Neil Shand, which was cancelled by the BBC after just one episode had been broadcast.

He also appeared in several British films, including The Dam Busters and The Wrong Arm of the Law, before moving back to Australia. Although probably best known as a comic actor, and especially for his appearances in Hancock''s Half Hour, he has since played a number of serious roles, notably in Peter Weir''s films Gallipoli (1981) and The Year of Living Dangerously (1982). He also worked on the Australian stage in the 1980s, in musicals such as My Fair Lady, where he received excellent reviews as Alfred Doolittle. In 2001, he appeared in the Australian comedy Let''s Get Skase.

Kerr also appeared in Glenview High and the 1998 television comedy series Minty.

Kerr has also been involved in documentaries, providing the narration for No Survivor - The Mysterious Loss of HMAS Sydney Nine Network Australia (1995), Malice or Mutiny for the ABC Australia 2003 and Animal X Natural Mystery Unit series for Discovery in the US, TV2 Norway and many others.

Richard Thorpe (February 24, 1896 - May 1, 1991) was an American film director.    Born Rollo Smolt Thorpe in Hutchinson, Kansas, he began his entertainment career performing in vaudeville and onstage. In 1921 he began in motion pictures as an actor and directed his first silent film in 1923. He went on to direct more than one hundred and eighty films. The first full length motion picture he directed for MGM was Last of the Pagans (1935) starring Ray Mala. After directing The Last Challenge in 1967, he retired from the film industry. He died in Palm Springs, California in 1991.

Thorpe is also known as the original director of The Wizard of Oz. He was fired after two weeks of shooting, because it was felt that his scenes did not have the right air of fantasy about them. Thorpe notoriously gave Judy Garland a blonde wig and cutesy "baby-doll" makeup that made her look like a girl in her late teens rather than an innocent Kansas farm girl of about thirteen. Both makeup and wig were discarded at the suggestion of George Cukor, who was brought in temporarily. Stills from Thorpe''s work on the film survive today.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Thorpe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd.

Robert James Hamer (31 March 1911, Kidderminster, Worcestershire – 4 December 1963, London) was a British film director and screenwriter. He was the son of the actor Gerald Hamer (1886-1972).

Hamer was won a scholarship to Cambridge University but was sent down (expelled) from Cambridge, and began his career in 1934 as a cutting room assistant and from 1935 worked as a film editor involved with such films as Hitchcock''s Jamaica Inn (1939) co-produced by Charles Laughton. At the end of the 1930s, he worked on documentaries for the GPO Film Unit.

When his boss at the GPO Alberto Cavalcanti moved to Ealing Studios, Hamer was invited to join him there. He gained some experience as a director by substituting for colleagues and contributed the ''haunted mirror'' sequence to Dead of Night (1945). He followed this with the three Ealing films under his own name for which he is best remembered: Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), It Always Rains on Sunday (1947), both featuring Googie Withers, and the black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), with Dennis Price and Alec Guinness.

Hamer died of pneumonia at the age of 52 at St Thomas''s Hospital in London. An alcoholic, who was homosexual in an era when it was taboo in the UK, Hamer''s career "now looks like the most serious miscarriage of talent in the postwar British cinema", according to film critic David Thomson.

Will Geer (March 9, 1902 – April 22, 1978) was an American actor and social activist. His original name was William Aughe Ghere. He is remembered for his portrayal of Grandpa Zebulon Tyler Walton in the 1970s TV series, The Waltons.  

Geer made his Broadway debut as Pistol in a 1928 production of Much Ado About Nothing, created the role of Mr. Mister in Marc Blitzstein''s The Cradle Will Rock, played Candy in John Steinbeck''s theatrical adaptation of his novella Of Mice and Men, and appeared in numerous plays and revues throughout the 1940s. From 1948 to 1951, he appeared in more than a dozen movies, including Winchester ''73 (as Wyatt Earp), Broken Arrow, Comanche Territory (all 1950) and Bright Victory (1951).

Geer became a member of the Communist Party of the United States in 1934. Geer was also influential in introducing Harry Hay to organizing in the Communist Party. In 1934, Geer and Hay gave support to a labor strike of the port of San Francisco; the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike which lasted 83 days. Though marred by violence, it was an organizing triumph, one that became a model for future union strikes Geer became a reader of the West Coast Communist newspaper People''s World.

Geer became a dedicated activist, touring government work camps in the 1930s with folk singers like Burl Ives and Woody Guthrie (whom he introduced to the People''s World and the Daily Worker; Guthrie would go on to write a column for the latter paper). In 1956, the duo released an album together on Folkways Records, titled Bound for Glory: Songs and Stories of Woody Guthrie. In his biography, fellow organizer and homosexual rights pioneer Harry Hay described Geer''s activism and outlined their activities while organizing for the strike. Geer is credited with introducing Guthrie to Pete Seeger at the ''Grapes of Wrath'' benefit Geer organized in 1940 for migrant farm workers.

Geer acted with the Group Theatre (New York) studying under Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg. Geer also acted in radio, appearing as Mephistopheles (the Devil) in the 1938 and 1944 productions of Norman Corwin''s The Plot to Overthrow Christmas. He also acted in the radio soap opera Bright Horizon.

Geer was blacklisted in the early 1950s for refusing to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. As a result, Geer appeared in very few films over the next decade. Among them was Salt of the Earth (1954) which was produced, directed, written, and starring blacklisted Hollywood personnel and told the story of a miners'' strike in New Mexico from a pro-union standpoint. The film was denounced as "subversive" and faced difficulties in its production and distribution as a consequence.

Yankovic is known for his humorous songs that make light of popular culture and that often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts. Since his first-aired comedy song in 1976, he had sold more than 12 million albums (as of 2007), recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and has performed more than 1,000 live shows. His works have earned him three Grammy Awards among nine nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the United States. Yankovic''s first top ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single ("White & Nerdy") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career.

Yankovic''s success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song''s original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists including Ben Folds, Hanson, Black Crowes, and The Presidents of the United States of America.

Smulders was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to a Dutch father and an English mother. She was named after her great-aunt, from whom she gained the nickname "Cobie".

Smulders worked in modeling, which she later said she "kind of hated", adding that the experience made her hesitant about pursuing acting as a career: "You know you go into these rooms, and I''ve had the experience of people judging you physically for so long and I was over that. But then it was like, ''Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice, and I have to have thoughts now''". After she quit modeling, she registered at the University of Victoria to study marine biology. During the summer, she took acting classes and decided to pursue her acting career.

On the New York stage, she has performed in Love, Loss, and What I Wore from at least June 10 to June 27, 2010. Her first permanent series role was in the short-lived ABC series Veritas: The Quest, and her second was television reporter Robin Scherbatsky on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother which quickly became popular. Joss Whedon has suggested that he considered her for the role of Wonder Woman in his draft of the eponymous film, which did not go into production. Smulders played Maria Hill in Whedon''s 2012 film The Avengers and reprises her role in the premiere of the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. television seriesand both the Russo brothers'' 2014 film Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron in 2015.

Herbert Mundin (21 August 1898 – 5 March 1939) was an English-born Hollywood character actor. He was frequently typecast in films as an older cheeky eccentric, a type helped by his jowled features and cheerful disposition.

He was born Herbert Thomas Mundin in St Helens, then in Lancashire (now part of Merseyside). His father was a nomadic, Primitive Methodist home missionary. His family moved within a short time of his birth to St Albans in Hertfordshire (the 1901 census data reveal that the family lived at St Helens Villa, Paxton Road, St Albans; his parents William and Jane apparently naming their house after the town where they first met and where Herbert was born).

Mundin was educated at St Albans School, and joined the Royal Navy during World War I. He began his acting career on the London stage during the 1920s. Mundin first travelled to America on 18 December 1923 for a series of theatrical engagements in New York. He sailed from Southampton on the RMS Aquitania and described himself in ship’s passenger manifest as 5''7" tall with a fair complexion, brown hair, blue eyes and a scar over his left eye. His big break as an actor was arguably with Gertrude Lawrence and Beatrice Lillie in Charlot''s Revue when it appeared on Broadway in 1925.

In 1931, after working in Australia and London, he permanently moved to the US, where he received a contract with Twentieth Century Fox Studios and enjoyed a successful career as a character actor in over 50 films.

Perhaps his most celebrated role was as Much in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), alongside Errol Flynn. Other film appearances included Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) with Charles Laughton and Clark Gable, and MGM''s David Copperfield (1935).

He died in Van Nuys, California following a car crash. He was killed instantly when the car in which he was riding collided with another car at a street intersection. The force of the impact threw open the door and hurled Mundin to the street.He received a fractured skull and crushed chest.He was 40 years old. The other occupants of the car were not injured.

Ken Takakura  , born Gouichi Oda (  February 16, 1931, in Kitakyūshū, Fukuoka, Japan), is a Japanese actor best known for his brooding style and the stoic presence he brings to his roles. Takakura gained his streetwise swagger and tough-guy persona watching yakuza turf battles over the lucrative black market and racketeering in postwar Fukuoka. This subject was covered in one of his most famous movies, Showa Zankyo-den (Remnants of Chivalry in the Showa Era), in which he played an honorable old-school yakuza among the violent post-war gurentai.

A graduate of Meiji University in Tokyo Takakura happened by an audition in 1955 at the Toei Film Company, and decided to look in. Toei found a natural in Takakura as he debuted with Denko Karate Uchi (Lightning Karate Blow) in 1956. Japan experienced a boom in gangster films in the 1960s as the Japanese people struggled with the generational differences between those raised in pre-war and post-war Japan and these were Takakura''s stock and trade. His breakout role would be in the 1965 film Abashiri Prison, and its sequel Abashiri Bangaichi: Bokyohen (Abashiri Prison: Longing for Home, also 1965), in which he played an ex-con antihero. By the time Takakura would leave Toei in 1976, he had appeared in over 180 films.

Takakura gained international recognition after starring in the 1970 war film Too Late the Hero as the cunning Imperial Japanese Major Yamaguchi, the 1975 Sydney Pollack sleeper hit The Yakuza with Robert Mitchum and is probably best known in the West for his role in Ridley Scott''s Black Rain (1989) where he surprises American cops played by Michael Douglas and Andy García with the line, "I do speak fucking English".

Tom Burlinson, an actor and singer born on 14th February 1956 in Toronto, Canada. His English parents had migrated to Canada after World War II. The family transferred to New Jersey in 1958, and Tom was the typical all-American youngster with the Little League baseball cap, striped T-shirt and turned-up jeans. In 1962 the family transferred to England with the father''s job and young Tom went to school with a North American accent. In 1965, just before Tom turned 10, the family transferred again, this time to Australia. After six months his parents divorced and his mother and two younger sisters went back to England, leaving him with dad and his older sister, Susan. His first public appearance was as Colonel Pickering in Mosman Primary School''s production of My Fair Lady. Moving to Bayview, Tom went to Pittwater High School, becoming school captain in his final year. His father wanted him to be a lawyer but he had other ideas. A friend had been accepted for NIDA so he auditioned and to his great surprise was accepted into the class of ''74. In 1981 his career break came when he was cast as Jim Craig in The Man From Snowy River, alongside Kirk Douglas, Jack Thompson and Sigrid Thornton. In 1983 he starred in Phar Lap, playing the young Tom Woodcock, alongside Martin Vaughan. He had a relationship with Nicole Kidman in 1986 during the filming of Windrider. They dated for nearly two years. Being a great Frank Sinatra fan since he was about seven, asking his mother to play ''the man in the hat'', he heard of the mini-series Sinatra being produced in America by Sinatra''s daughter, Tina. He put himself forward for the main role but was selected for singing the voice of the young Sinatra. Now he was a singer and soon sang in his first musical in 1993, How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying. Here he met the young singer and dancer Mandy Carnie. They married in December 1996. They had their first child, Mia, in April 1999; a son, Guy, in 2001; and another daughter, Ricky, in 2007. In 1998 he created Frank, The Sinatra Story In Song, which opened at the Seymour Centre in Sydney, Australia, then went on to other major cities. Incredibly, Old Blue Eyes, The Chairman of the Board, Sinatra died around the opening time of the show. In recent times, he has been one of the three judges on Australia''s Got Talent.

On 3 March 1993, backstage in the Footbridge Theatre, Sydney, with the grease paint, costumes and stage props, Tom Burlinson had his hands painted by Australian artist Sharon Davson to create original autographed handprints. Only two handprints were created.

These handprints were to assist in environmental and world peace initiatives. Davson initiated this ‘hand prints for charitable causes’ activity in April 1992, and invited Neil Diamond to launch it with her at a national press conference.

In 2009, Davson incorporated one of Tom Burlinson’s handprints into a massive work of art which is touring Australia with the multi-million dollar retrospective exhibition titled, Davson ~ World Leaders &amp; Enlightenment

Photographs of these events are now in the Davson Arts Museum peace and environment centre in Newcastle, NSW, Australia.

Johnny Whitworth (born October 31, 1975) is an American actor.

His early years were spent in his birth place of Charleston, South Carolina, with his mother. When he grew older, he moved to Dallas, Texas with his father (his parents are divorced). At age 15/16 in 1991, he won the 1st Young and Modern Man Contest. Shortly after, he moved to Los Angeles with his mother and at the age of 18 started his acting career with a guest appearance on Party of Five in 1994. His debut in movies was with Bye Bye Love in 1995. That same year, he played A.J. in the film Empire Records. The movie became a cult classic.

He quit acting after his first few movies, but then made a comeback in 1997s The Rainmaker. He currently has a recurring role on the CBS crime drama CSI: Miami, where he plays bad-boy Detective Jake Berkeley, a love interest of Calleigh Duquesne. The storyline is swiftly making Whitworth''s character a controversial one, as his competition for Calleigh is long-time CSI agent Eric Delko. Since the end of Season 5 and throughout Season 6, Jake was no longer an ATF agent but a Miami-Dade homicide detective working with the CSIs. Season 7 sees Whitworth return in the first episode, with a promise of more to come.

In 2007, he appeared in the film 3:10 to Yuma, starring Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, and in 2009, co-starred in Gamer with Gerard Butler.

He appeared in the films Locked in, Valley of the Sun, and Neil Burger''s Limitless. He also will be playing the villain Blackout in the 2012 sequel and reboot Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.

Although he has used many aliases in the past, he is best known for his work as DJ Tiësto. On his latest productions, however, he has dropped the "DJ" label and is now known simply as "Tiësto", an alias which is a twist of his childhood nickname.

In 1997, he founded the label Black Hole Recordings with Arny Bink, where he released the Magik and In Search of Sunrise CD series. Tiësto met producer Dennis Waakop Reijers in 1998, and the two have worked together extensively since then. Reijers is credited as producer, writer, composer, or arranger on many of Tiësto''s releases. In 1999 and 2000 Tiësto collaborated with Ferry Corsten to create Gouryella. His 2000 remix of Delerium''s "Silence" featuring Sarah McLachlan exposed him to more mainstream audiences. In 2001, he released his first solo album In My Memory which gave him several major hits that launched his career. He ranked in the #1 poll position 3 consecutive times in the DJ Magazine Top 100 Popularity Poll from 2002 to 2004.

Just after releasing his second studio album Just Be in 2004 at the Summer Olympics, he performed live at the opening ceremony in Athens, Greece, becoming the first DJ to play live on stage at an Olympics. Tracks he made especially for the Olympics were mixed together and released as the mix compilation Parade of the Athletes later that year. In April 2007 Tiësto launched both his radio show Tiësto''s Club Life on Radio 538 in the Netherlands and released his third studio album Elements of Life. The album reached number one on the Dutch album chart as well on "Billboard Top Electronic Albums" in the U.S. and received a nomination for a Grammy Award in 2008.Tiësto released his fourth studio album Kaleidoscope in October 2009.  As at 2012, Tiësto attained the #3 poll position of the DJ Mag 100 Popularity Poll, and he refers to the styles he mainly plays as House, Electro House, and Progressive House. He plays a new balanced sound sometimes demonstrating lesser known genres such as Dubstep. For nostalgia, Tiësto still throws in the odd Trance House record, the style he became attached to in the early 2000''s.

Clinton Richard Dawkins, FRS, FRSL (born 26 March 1941), known as Richard Dawkins, is a British ethologist, evolutionary biologist and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford''s Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008.

Dawkins came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centered view of evolution and introduced the term meme. In 1982, he introduced into evolutionary biology an influential concept, presented in his book The Extended Phenotype, that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism''s body, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other organisms.

Dawkins is an atheist and humanist, a Vice President of the British Humanist Association and supporter of the Brights movement. He is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argued against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he described evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker. He has since written several popular science books, and makes regular television and radio appearances, predominantly discussing these topics. He has been referred to in the media as "Darwin''s Rottweiler," a reference to English biologist T. H. Huxley, who was known as "Darwin''s Bulldog" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin''s evolutionary ideas. In his 2006 book The God Delusion, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion—a fixed false belief. As of January 2010, the English-language version had sold more than two million copies and had been translated into 31 languages, making it his most popular book to date.

Jack Kinney attended John Muir Junior High School in Los Angeles, California (1925), and attended John C. Fremont High School (1926 - 1928) there with Roy Williams. Both Fremont football players, they would later be hired by Walt Disney in 1930 to work at the Walt Disney Studio on Hyperion Avenue.

He also served as director of most of the "package films" during the 1940s, including The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. In the mid-1950s, he supervised new animation used to tie some of the old shorts together for Disney''s television efforts.

In 1959, Jack left Disney to start (with his brother Dick) Jack Kinney Productions, an independent animation studio. Among other work they provided animation for King Features Syndicate''s 1960 Popeye series.

In 1988, Kinney published a short memoir, Walt Disney and Assorted Other Characters: An Unauthorized Account of the Early Years at Disney''s.

The family lived in Miami Beach, Florida during the fall and  winter and traveled in Europe during the spring and summer. She first  appeared on stage when she was nine years old.

She lost her  mother at the age of 11 to Ovarian Cancer and subsequently navigated  adolescence on her own. Without a mother to guide her, she learned about  becoming a woman and a lady through watching movies, and reading  classic romantic literature such as Jane Austen, the Bronte Sisters,  Emily Dickinson and Lord Byron. By being brought up in a household with  all men Robin learned about life as a woman through her imagination. She  would later draw on her self-formed nature to create her acting roles.

Robin  signed with a talent agency in Miami, Florida at the age of 14. Already  a great beauty, the resulting contract landed her a national television  commercial, fashion modeling assignments in Glamour Magazine and on the  runway for designer Oleg Cassini.

Through  Sarah Lawrence college in New York, she studied acting in London,  England. Robin performed the leading roles in both musical comedies,  Guys and Dolls as Sarah Brown to Sky Masterson played by Jeff Zinn  (founder of the Wellfleet Harbor Actors Theater), and Philia in Funny  Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum for the North Country Players New  England summer repertory theater, under the direction of Ron Bennett.

Robin made her movie debut in independent films. She appeared briefly in the Bill Murray comedy Coming Attractions (1980). Soon her resume began to grow with a role in Outside Chance (1978) a CBS movie of the week with Yvette Mimieux. She arrived as a leading lady, with the David Schmoeller iconic mystery/horror film Tourist Trap (1979), which she starred in with Chuck Connors.

She then moved into major motion pictures, at MGM Studios, director Martin Davidson saw a photograph of her on the wall of the studio''s art director and cast Sherwood in a small role in the romantic comedy, Hero at Large (1980) with John Ritter.  Immediately following, showing a keen comedic talent, she was  delightful as a Marin County hippie feminist, in a supporting role  opposite Tuesday Weld in Serial (1980) for Paramount. She then was given the chance to work with director Brian De Palma in a scene stealing cameo role with John Travolta in Blow Out (1981) for Columbia Studios. Her break-through role came when she signed to star opposite Charles Bronson as his emotionally traumatized daughter in the high profile, box office hit, Death Wish II (1982) for MGM, directed by Michael Winner.

McHugh debuted on Broadway in The Fall Guy in 1925. Warner Bros. hired him as a contract player in 1930. McHugh played everything from lead actor to sidekick and would often provide comedy relief. He appeared in over 150 films and television productions and worked with almost every star at Warner Bros. He was a close friend of James Cagney and appeared in more Cagney movies than any other actor. He appeared with him in eleven movies between 1932 and 1953. Their friendship lasted until McHugh''s death.

By the 1950s his film career had begun to decline, as evinced by his smaller role in Career (1959). From 1964 to 1965 he played the role of Willie Walters, a live-in handyman, on ABC''s sitcom The Bing Crosby Show. His last television appearance was as Charlie Wingate in the episode "The Fix-It Man" on CBS''s Lancer western series. McHugh played a handyman in that role too.

McHugh was married to Dorothy Spencer. He had three children and two grandchildren.

The film grabbed the attention of US film critics and moviegoers, and facilitated her entry into the American film industry. She subsequently relocated to Los Angeles.

Born in Monterrey, Cavazos began her acting career at the age of 15, and made her film debut in Busi Cortes’ 1988 El Secreto de Romalia. She has acted in numerous Mexican films and television series since then, and has also done a fair amount of work in the U.S., appearing in such television dramas as "Sugar Town". Cavazos is sometimes credited as "Rosita Lumi Cavazos".

Frank D. Williams was born March 21, 1893,  as Frank Douglas Williams, to James and Lucinda Williams in the small community of Nashville, Missouri.

In 1912, Williams became a cameraman at Keystone Studios. There, in 1914, he was the photographer for many of Charlie Chaplin''s first-year pictures, including Kid Auto Races at Venice which was the first film released in which The Tramp appeared. Williams is credited as appearing in Kid Auto Races at Venice, playing a cameraman, but his appearance is in doubt. For a time he was chief cinematographer at Keystone, and a large number of the studio''s 1914 films are credited to him as photographer. He defected to work for the short-lived Sterling Motion Pictures, but returned to Keystone when Sterling closed in 1915. He also worked a camera for Henry Lehrman''s L-Ko Kompany, Reliance-Majestic Studios, and Bluebird Photoplays.

When Roscoe Arbuckle formed a new motion picture company, Comique, in 1917, he hired Williams to be his cameraman. At Comique, Williams also shot Buster Keaton''s first film appearance, The Butcher Boy (1917). His tenure there was also short; he shot three films for Arbuckle (Butcher Boy, A Reckless Romeo, and The Rough House) before departing to start his own lab. His business did not get off the ground quickly, and he supplemented his income by continuing to work as a cameraman. He was director of photography at Sessue Hayakawa''s Haworth Pictures Corporation and is credited with 15 pictures that came out of that studio between 1919 and 1921.

While he was working as a cameraman at various studios, Williams worked on his idea for a traveling matte in which the actions of actors would be combined with a filmed moving background. Available technology prevented him from achieving the effect he envisioned until he built a printer himself to his own specification. He filed for a patent in May 1916, and it was granted in July 1918. The process was first used in a motion picture in 1922''s Wild Honey.

Fred Berry, Jr.

From TV''s What''s Happening!! (1977). Seated, L-R: Fred Berry, Ernest Lee Thomas, and Haywood Nelson (back to camera). Standing: Shirley Hemphill.

Fred Allen Berry (March 19, 1951 – October 21, 2003) was an American actor and street dancer. He was best known for the role of Fred "Rerun" Stubbs on the 1970s television show What''s Happening!!

Before starring on What''s Happening!! he was a member of the Los Angeles-based dance troupe The Lockers, with whom he appeared on the third episode of Saturday Night Live. He also appeared on the dance music show Soul Train, and was featured in the program''s signature line dance segment doing the memorable early 1970s dance step "the slo-mo".

What''s Happening!! aired from 1976 to 1979.

He reprised his role as Rerun in the series What''s Happening Now!! but he was only on that show for one season. Berry asked for more money than the rest of the cast (believing he was the reason people tuned in).  Berry''s widow, Essie Berry, told Urbanite magazine at Georgia State University that their unwillingness to pay Fred Berry his due in both shows led to their early cancellations. During the 1990s, Berry became a Baptist minister and lost 100 lbs after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

Berry was married five times to four different women, the first of whom he married twice.

On October 21, 2003, Berry died at his Los Angeles home, where he was recovering from a stroke.

He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

Jay Waverly North (born August 3, 1951) is an American actor. Beginning a career as a child actor at the age of six, he became a household name during the early 1960s for his role as the well-meaning but mischievous Dennis Mitchell on the CBS situation comedy Dennis the Menace, based on the comic strip created by Hank Ketcham.

Dennis the Menace premiered on CBS on Sunday, October 4, 1959, and quickly became a hit with audiences. North was paid $500 per episode, his strawberry red hair was bleached platinum blonde for the role, and the eight-year-old was instructed to "shave" a year off his age when speaking with the press. North''s mother continued to work at AFTRA full-time to support the two of them, and hired business managers to invest North''s earnings for him. In a 1993 interview with Filmfax magazine, North spoke highly of his mother, saying: "I want to make it very clear about one thing. I never supported my mother during (Dennis the Menace). She earned her own money from AFTRA. She never lived off my earnings. I know that sometimes happens with child actors, but it was not true in my situation."

While Mrs. North worked, her sister Marie Hopper and brother-in-law Hal Hopper served as North''s on-set guardians during filming for Dennis The Menace. In addition to filming the series, North appeared as Dennis in commercials for the show''s sponsors, Kellogg''s cereals, Best Foods mayonnaise, Skippy peanut butter, and Bosco chocolate milk, and regularly traveled around the country with his aunt and uncle on the weekends to promote the show. These obligations, combined with the required three hours a day of school, took their toll on North, and by the end of the first season, the eight-year-old had begun to feel the pressures of being the lead star of a popular show.

By the fall of 1961, the series was in its third season, and North was earning $2,500 an episode. The show remained in the top 20, but North had grown tired and frustrated with the pressures of carrying a hit show and the long work hours. Complicating matters was his relationship with his Aunt Marie. Many years later, North revealed that his aunt physically and verbally abused him when he made mistakes on the set or did not perform to her standards. North''s mother, Dorothy, and the rest of the Dennis The Menace cast were unaware of the abuse, and North concealed his unhappiness for fear of retribution from his aunt. In July 2007, North''s childhood co-star, Jeannie Russell, who portrayed Margaret Wade on the series, told radio host Stu Shostak in a radio interview: "''The show comes first.'' This was the ethic that we were raised in. Had I seen any abuse or any horrible upset on Jay''s part, I would have noticed. It would have impacted me. It would have upset me terribly."[12]

Ben Stassen is a Belgian film producer and director. He founded nWave Pictures in 1994, producing highly successful CGI ride films including the groundbreaking Devils Mine. Starting in 1997, Ben Stassen began focusing on large format films usually screened at IMAX theaters, and made some of the most successful large format films to date, including Thrill Ride: The Science of Fun and Alien Adventure. Contrary to most large format films, which mix education with spectacular visuals, most of Stassen''s films are aimed exclusively at the entertainment market. As IMAX theaters around the world increasingly became capable of screening stereoscopic (3-D) films in the late nineties, Stassen quickly embraced this new technology, and directed a succession of popular 3-D large format films, such as Encounter in the Third Dimension and Haunted Castle. Upon screening "Haunted Castle", Imax corporation sent a fax to all the exhibitors warning them about the content of the film. Imax went as far as labeling "Haunted Castle" as degrading to the brand. This triggered a strong reaction from both the exhibitors and the press. The film was marketed as "The film Imax corporation does not want you to see". It went on the become a huge success worldwide.

In 2004, Stassen produced and directed "Wild Safari", the first 3D wildlife film for the giant screen (Imax).

nWave is also the leading producer and distributor of 3D ride films and 4D attraction films with over 30 titles in their library. Over 200,000 people a day see one of nWave''s films in theme parks, science centers, zoo, aquaria and musea around the world.

Ben Stassen''s first feature length animated film, Fly Me to the Moon, was released in North America on 15 August 2008 on both regular size and IMAX screens, exclusively in 3-D. According to nWave, Fly Me to the Moon was the first animated film to be designed, created, and released solely in 3-D. The film was originally announced for the spring or summer of 2007. The delay is believed to be the result of the slow roll-out of 3-D projection technology.

On 7 May 2008, nWave announced that its next feature length animated film would be titled Around the World in 50 Years and that it too would be directed by Ben Stassen. It was released in 2010 titled Sammy''s Adventures: The Secret Passage.

Stassen was also involved in the production of several movies directed by famed Croatian film director Krsto Papić, most notably "My Uncle''s Legacy" (Život sa stricem), the film was nominated for a Golden Globe (Best Foreign Film category) in 1990.

Stassen is widely quoted as a leading pioneer of 3D cinema, considering 3D as the 2nd revolution in the history of cinema, second only to the transition from silent film to the talkies. He mostly refers to American 3D film as 2.5 D cinema. In his opinion most filmmakers do not make any effort to use 3D as a new language of cinema. They simply shoot their 2D films with two cameras creating a little depth behind the screen with the odd in-your-face effect. He is also quite outspoken about the inadequacies of the 3D digital theaters. The essence of 3D cinema is its ability to greatly enhance the sense of immersion in the story being told. But there is no way to achieve real immersion unless you have floor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall screens. The image must fill you field of vision as much as possible. The long term viability of 3D cinema will depend on the exhibitors willingness to build theaters designed specifically for 3D immersion.

nWave Pictures is currently producing two 3D features. The sequel to Sammy''s Adventures ("Escape From Paradise") and African Safari 3D, a live action 3D adventure documentary taking the audience from the cost of Skeleton Coast in Namibia to the top of the Kilimanjaro.

Hennie grew up in Lambertseter in Oslo. In his late teens he was sentenced for graffiti, and became an outcast in the community for confessing to the police. This personal story contributed much of the background for the movie Uno. The conviction against Hennie was in fact one of the first such cases in Norway.

Hennie was admitted to the Norwegian National Academy of Theatre after applying four times. He graduated in 2001, and has since acted both at Teatret Vårt in Molde (2001–2002) and at Oslo Nye Teater (2002–), where he has been in plays such as Hamlet, and Kvinnen som giftet seg med en kalkun (English: The woman who married a turkey).

His main success, however, has been as a film actor. He made his debut starring in the feature film Jonny Vang in 2003. Though the director, Jens Lien, originally thought Hennie was too young for the role, the actor convinced him he was the right man for the film. The same year he also acted in the movies Buddy and Ulvesommer, and the next year he made his debut as a director and writer with the movie Uno, in which he also acted. For this film Hennie, and his co-star Nicolai Cleve Broch, went into hard physical training for six months to perform convincingly as bodybuilders.

He won the Amanda Award – the main Norwegian film award – for "Best Direction" for the movie Uno in 2005, and that same year he was also among the nominees for "Best Actor" and "Best Film". He also won an Amanda award as "Best Actor" for the movie Jonny Vang in 2003. He was named one of European films "Shooting Stars" by European Film Promotion in 2004. In 2001 he was also named "Theatre talent of the year" by the newspaper Dagbladet. In 2008 Hennie starred in the movie Max Manus, where he played the role of the Norwegian war hero by that name. The movie had a large budget by Norwegian standards, and was met with great expectations. His next upcoming international film is Age of Heroes, a world war 2 movie primarily shot in Norway starring Sean Bean and Danny Dyer.

Dunham also starred in The Jeff Dunham Show for one season on the network in 2009.[1] His style has been described as "a dressed-down, more digestible version of Don Rickles with multiple personality disorder". Describing his characters, Time observes, "All of them are politically incorrect, gratuitously insulting and ill tempered." Dunham has been credited with reviving ventriloquism, and doing more to promote the art form than anyone since Edgar Bergen.

Dunham has been called "America''s favorite comedian" by Slate.com, and according to the concert industry publication Pollstar, he is the top-grossing standup act in North America, and is among the most successful acts in Europe as well. As of March 2009, he has sold over four million DVDs, an additional 7 million dollars in merchandise sales, and received more than 350 million hits on YouTube (his introduction of Achmed the Dead Terrorist in Spark of Insanity is the ninth most watched YouTube video). A Very Special Christmas Special was the most-watched telecast in Comedy Central history, with its DVD going quadruple platinum (selling over 400,000) in its first two weeks. Forbes.com ranked Dunham as the third highest-paid comedian in the United States behind Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock, and reported that he was one of the highest-earning comics from June 2008 to June 2009, earning approximately $30 million during that period.

Hopefully they''ll look at me and say, ''Well, he''s succeeded and come out and has a pretty good life."

After his interview with The Advocate, Kmetko hosted the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association''s Excellence in Journalism Awards on October 4, 2005, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, California.

Austin wrestled for several well-known wrestling promotions such as World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and most famously, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which later became World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002. Billed as "The Most Popular Superstar in WWE History", he gained significant mainstream popularity in the WWF during the mid-to-late 1990s as "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, a disrespectful, beer-drinking antihero who routinely defied his boss, Vince McMahon. This defiance was often shown by Austin flipping off McMahon and incapacitating him with the Stone Cold Stunner, his finishing move. McMahon inducted Austin into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009. Austin held nineteen championships throughout his professional wrestling career, and is recognized by WWE as a six-time world champion, having held the WWF Championship on six occasions, and the fifth Triple Crown Champion. He was also the winner of the 1996 King of the Ring tournament, as well as the 1997, 1998 and 2001 Royal Rumbles. He was forced to retire from in ring competition in early 2003 due to a series of knee and neck injuries sustained throughout his career. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, he was featured as the Co-General Manager and "Sheriff" of Raw. Since 2005, he has continued to make occasional appearances. In 2011, Steve Austin returned to WWE to host the reality series Tough Enough.  On August 14, 2002, Austin was arrested and charged with domestic abuse. He pleaded no contest on November 25, 2002, and was given a year''s probation, a $1,000 fine, and ordered to carry out 80 hours of community service.] Marshall told Fox News that Austin beat her three times and that the 2002 incident was the result of roid rage. She also stated that WWE knew of the abuse, working to conceal the bruises on her face, and kept her from revealing that Austin hit her, as it would cost the company millions of dollars.

During his early years as a wrestler, Austin was a technical wrestler. However, after his neck injury against Owen Hart in 1997, he changed his style from technical to brawler. His most famous finishing move is the Stone Cold Stunner, or simply Stunner. During his time as The Ringmaster he used the Million Dollar Dream as finisher, since it was Ted DiBiase''s finisher. During his time in WCW, Austin used the Stun Gun as finisher

One of Austin''s taunts during the Attitude Era was to show the middle finger.] In August 2001, Austin cut a promo, debuting his catchphrase "What?", which is used today by fans when they want to mock wrestlers during promos', 'Victoria, Texas, U.S.', 1, '/gENXbrL2EnzsWK7mwP131mUv0CD.jpg'),

Irene Dunne (born Irene Marie Dunn, December 20, 1898 – September 4, 1990) was an American film actress and singer of the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s. Dunne was nominated five times for the Academy Award for Best Actress, for her performances in Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948). In 1985, Dunne was given Kennedy Center Honors for her services to the arts.  Dunne was discovered by Hollywood while starring with the road company of Show Boat in 1929. She signed a contract with RKO and appeared in her first movie, Leathernecking (1930), a film version of the musical Present Arms. Already in her thirties when she made her first film, she would be in competition with younger actresses for roles, and found it advantageous to evade questions that would reveal her age. Her publicists encouraged the belief that she was born in 1901 or 1904, and the former is the date engraved on her tombstone.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Dunne blossomed into a popular screen heroine in movies such as the original Back Street (1932) and the original Magnificent Obsession (1935) and re-created her role as Magnolia in Show Boat (1936), directed by James Whale. Love Affair (1939) is the first of three films she made opposite Charles Boyer. She starred, and sang "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", in the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers film version of the musical Roberta (1935).

Dunne was apprehensive about attempting her first comedy role, as the title character in Theodora Goes Wild (1936), but discovered that she enjoyed it. She turned out to possess an aptitude for comedy, with a flair for combining the elegant and the madcap, a quality she displayed in such films as The Awful Truth (1937) and My Favorite Wife (1940), both co-starring Cary Grant. Other roles include Julie Gardiner Adams in Penny Serenade (1941), again with Grant, Anna and the King of Siam (1946) as Anna Leonowens, Lavinia Day in Life with Father (1947), and Marta Hanson in I Remember Mama (1948). In The Mudlark (1950), she was nearly unrecognizable under heavy makeup as Queen Victoria.

The comedy It Grows on Trees (1952) became Dunne''s last screen performance, although she remained on the lookout for suitable film scripts for years afterwards. The following year, she was the opening act on the 1953 March of Dimes showcase in New York City. While in town, she made an appearance as the mystery guest on What''s My Line? She also made television performances on Ford Theatre, General Electric Theater, and the Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, continuing to act until 1962.

In 1952–53, Dunne played newspaper editor Susan Armstrong in the radio program Bright Star. The syndicated 30-minute comedy-drama also starred Fred MacMurray.

Dunne commented in an interview that she had lacked the "terrifying ambition" of some other actresses and said, "I drifted into acting and drifted out. Acting is not everything. Living is."', 'Louisville, Kentucky, USA', 1, '/nkgi5ygQCGBUb3OvKdHdBAaHjS0.jpg'),

Barmak directed Osama with significant funding and assistance from the elder Makhmalbaf. The Iranian director invested thousands of dollars in the film, lending Barmak his Arriflex camera and encouraging him to send the movie to international festivals, which eventually generated further funding from Japanese and Irish producers. Barmak received "UNESCO’s Fellini Silver Medal" for his drama, Osama, in 2003.

Barmak is also director of the Afghan Children Education Movement (ACEM), an association that promotes literacy, culture and the arts, which was also founded by Makhmalbaf.

His breakthrough was directing Lorraine Hansberry''s To Be Young, Gifted and Black, which he restaged for television in 1972.

Schultz'' earliest film projects combined low comedy with profound social comment (Honeybaby, Honeybaby and Cooley High), reaching a peak with the ensemble comedy Car Wash (1976) and Which Way Is Up? (1977), starring Richard Pryor.

In 1978, Schultz took the reins of the musical Sergeant Pepper''s Lonely Hearts Club Band with the largest budget ever entrusted to an African-American film director to that date. However, upon its release, the project was a commercial and critical failure. Schultz would go on to make prominent films such as Scavenger Hunt (1979), Carbon Copy (1981), and Disorderlies (1987).

More recently, Schultz has worked in television, piloting episodes of such style-conscious series as The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and Picket Fences, as well as an abundance of made-for-TV movies.

Ironically, as famous as Paul was, his dummy, Jerry Mahoney, was probably more famous. Not since Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy in the previous two decades had a ventriloquist and his dummy known equal celebrity.

Entering the spotlight on the Edward Bowes "Original Amateur Hour" (1948), he began working soon after in a review show in which Major Bowes would showcase the winners of his radio program. He started his television career on the CBS program The Bigelow Show (1948) in 1948; The Paul Winchell Show (1950), originally called "The Spiedel Show," in 1950; and, finally, the best-known of his shows Winchell-Mahoney Time (1965). With a clubhouse premise, his dummies Jerry Mahoney and Knucklehead Smiff--another of Paul''s characters--as the clubhouse leaders, and the music of the bandleader Milton Delugg. A new innovation of Winchell''s was to replace the dummy''s hands with those of puppeteers who were hidden behind the dummies in a crate. Winch also played many serous dramatic roles on television without his dummy sidekicks.

What may be even more famous is that he created the voice of Tigger for the Walt Disney Company''s "Winnie The Pooh" motion-picture series, based on the famous books by A.A. Milne. He played the role behind the scenes until 1999, when he was replaced by Jim Cummings, who also voiced Pooh from the time that Sterling Holloway died. He was also the voice of many other world-famous cartoon characters.

A little-known fact about Winchell is that he was one of the original inventors of an artificial heart--years before the first successful transplant with such of a device--an automobile that runs on battery power, a method for breeding tilapia, and many other inventions that are still around today.

She danced with Fred Astaire in Three Little Words (1950) and with Gene Kelly in On the Town  (1949). Blonde, slim of build, and a dancing sensation, she appeared in  a string of light-hearted but successful films. Vera-Ellen retired from  acting in the late 1950s.

Vera''s career died down in the late 1950s once filmed musicals lost  their fashion. It was later discovered that, due to the dancer''s  compulsive dieting obsession, she had silently battled anorexia  throughout much of the 50s before anyone was even aware or doctors had  even coined the term or devised treatments. Moreover, she had developed  severe arthritis which forced an early retirement. In order to combat  it, she reverted back to taking dance lessons again. The worst blows  suffered, however, was in her personal life. On top of of two two failed  marriages, she lost her only child, Victoria Ellen Rothschild, to  Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in 1963. With one unhappy and tragic  event compounded by another, she became a virtual recluse.

Little  was heard for decades until it was discovered that she had died on  August 30, 1981, at age 60 following a long bout with cancer at UCLA  Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was buried at Glen Haven Memorial  Park in Sylmar, California. Perhaps less remembered today compared to  several of the big stars that shared the stage with her, Vera-Ellen was a  lithe and lovely presence who deserved a better personal life than she  got.

In 1945, he signed with MGM, and for the next several years, played mostly secondary roles as gangsters or boxers. He made his film debut with "Boston Blackie Booked on Suspicion" (1945) and quickly followed with "Wonder Man" (1945). Released from his contract in 1948, he returned to Broadway where he worked with Mae West; the next year he signed on with Warner Brothers, where he earned leading roles in such films as "The Damned Don''t Cry" (1950), "Highway 301" (1950) and "Tomorrow is Another Day" (1951). Warner Brothers often had him playing the villain in several of its western films, such as "Dallas" (1950), and "Back to God''s Country" (1953). With the end of his contract in 1953, he began his own film company, Robert Alexander Productions, while also freelancing for other studios and moving on to guest star roles on television shows.

She was a regular on Sid Caesar''s show "Caesar''s Hour" (1954) for one season in the 1950s. She first gained attention on stage while appearing in the musical play "The Threepenny Opera" with Lotte Lenya. Then, in 1964, she truly became famous when she appeared in the original Broadway production of "Fiddler on the Roof" as Yente the Matchmaker. In this supporting role, she stole the show night after night. In 1966, she went to work on a new Broadway musical, "Mame", directed by her second husband, Gene Saks. For the featured role of Vera Charles in "Mame" she won a Tony. The star of the show, Angela Lansbury, also won a Tony. In 1971, Bea appeared on the hit sitcom "All in the Family" (1971) as Maude Findlay, Edith Bunker''s cousin, who was forever driving Archie Bunker crazy with her liberal politics. This guest appearance led to her own series, entitled "Maude" (1972), in 1972. The show was a hit, and ran for six years, during which time many controversial topics, including abortion, were tackled. Bea also won an Emmy for her work on "Maude" (1972). During the show''s run, Bea repeated the role of Vera Charles in the film version of Mame (1974), again directed by Gene Saks. She also appeared on none other than The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) (TV). In 1983, she started work on a new sitcom, "Amanda''s" (1983), which was patterned after British situation comedy "Fawlty Towers" (1975), but it didn''t last long. In 1985, however, she got sweet compensation when her new sitcom, "The Golden Girls" (1985) hit the air. Co-starring Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty, it was a show about four middle-aged women living in Miami. It was an immediate hit, and ran for seven seasons. All of the cast members, including Bea, won Emmys during the show''s run. It should be worth noting that both "Maude" (1972) and "The Golden Girls" (1985) had to be canceled when Bea announced she was leaving each of them. In both cases, she left when she thought each show was at its peak and, in both cases, the producers of the shows realized the shows just wouldn''t be the same without her. Since "The Golden Girls" (1985) was canceled in 1992, Bea had kept a low profile, appearing in only a couple of movies: For Better or Worse (1995) and Enemies of Laughter (2000). In 1999, she made a very successful and welcome Comedy Central Presents: The N.Y. Friars Club Roast of Jerry Stiller (1999) (TV). She lives on a ranch in California.

She has also traveled with the international group ''Up With People'', on its European tour and performed in Equity playhouses across the United States.

Her first experience in front of the camera was in a small role in the TV movie Bare Essence (1982), but it was not until 1994 when she got recognition from Horror/Sci-Fi fans worldwide after co-starring in Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead (1994). Don Coscarelli gave her the role of Rocky mainly because of her tough look and the fact that she was a student of the martial arts. To date, it remains as her most important cinematic performance and even nowadays she keeps going to Horror conventions and Phantasm reunions to meet her numerous fans.

Since her appearance in Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead (1994), Gloria had a couple of brief roles in The Devil''s Advocate (1997) and in The Horse Whisperer (1998). More recently, she''s been working in a variety of national commercials.

After freelancing with many companies, he joined the New York City Ballet as a principal dancer to learn George Balanchine''s style of movement.

Baryshnikov has spearheaded many of his own artistic projects and has been associated in particular with promoting modern dance, premiering dozens of new works, including many of his own. His success as a dramatic actor on stage, cinema and television has helped him become probably the most widely recognized contemporary ballet dancer.

Lee Gordon Demarbre (born 8 March 1972 in Chicoutimi, Quebec) is a Canadian cult film maker. As the president and key person in the Ottawa, Ontario based Odessa Filmworks production company, he has led the creation of several internationally-shown films such as Harry Knuckles and the Pearl Necklace and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter.

Demarbre graduated from St Matthew Catholic High School in Orleans, Ontario in 1990 then graduated from Carleton University''s film studies programme. In 1998, his short film trailer martial arts movie spoof Harry Knuckles garnered attention and led to longer form versions featuring the Harry Knuckles character. This led to a debut full-length feature film, Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter which featured many of the actors from the earlier Harry Knuckles films.

Prior to his full-time commitment with Odessa, Demarbre worked for Ottawa''s ByTowne Cinema. He is presently programming films for another Ottawa cinema, the Mayfair Theatre.

In January 2007, Demarbre directed the Odessa''s project The Dead Sleep Easy, filmed on location in Mexico and starring Ian Hodgkinson. His movie Smash Cut was released in 2009 after post-production from July 2008.

He is also host of the weekly Ottawa film talk radio programme Drunken Master Revue on CKCU-FM. He also presents "Saturday Night Sinema", which is a monthly showcase of rare or classic cult film prints at the Mayfair Theatre.

Bernard Morton "Bernie" Kopell (born June 21, 1933) is an American television character actor who is probably best known for his role as Dr. Adam Bricker ("Doc") in The Love Boat. He also portrayed Alan-a-Dale in When Things Were Rotten, Jerry Bauman in That Girl, Siegfried in Get Smart, and Louie Pallucci in The Doris Day Show.

Kopell also played several characters on the hit sitcom Bewitched including the witches'' Apothecary, and the warlock Alonzo in episode # 239, "The Warlock in the Gray Flannel Suit." He played a director in an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents ("Good-Bye George," original air date December 13, 1963).

He had a cameo as a patient in the Scrubs episode, "My Friend the Doctor", as well as an episode of the Disney Channel Original Series, The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody. He also portrayed a plastic surgeon who gave Ed Brown a facelift on Chico and the Man.

Kopell''s role as Doc on The Love Boat was parodied in a humorous cameo appearance on Late Show with David Letterman in 1995. Two entries in that night''s Top Ten List poked fun at The Love Boat, one at the Doc character specifically. The camera cut to Kopell, who was sitting in the audience, and he stormed out of the theater.In a dream sequence of Fresh Prince of Bel Air Kopell made a parody cameo of himself as an actor who played a ship''s doctor so many times he offers to perform an operation for real!

Kopell made a cameo appearance in the 2008 film adaptation of Get Smart. Recently he has been seen in television advertisements for Nasalcrom, carefully enunciating the product''s name and assuring viewers "that''s right, it''s a spray".

Kopell has also appeared as guest star in the Monk episode "Mr. Monk and the Critic", playing Mr. Gilson, the restroom attendant. Kopell also guest starred in a 2009 episode of My Name is Earl entitled "Pinky."

Kopell has performed in the theater and played the lead role in the off Broadway production of "Viagra Falls" in 2010.

Kopell was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Pauline (née Taran) and Al Bernard Kopell.

Dee Dee Ramone (born Douglas Glenn Colvin) (September 18, 1951  – June 5, 2002) was an American songwriter and musician, best known as founding member, bassist and main songwriter of the punk rock band the Ramones.

Though nearly all of the Ramones'' songs were credited equally to all the band members, Dee Dee was the band''s second most prolific lyricist and songwriter, writing many of the band''s most well-known songs, such as "53rd &amp; 3rd", "Commando", "Rockaway Beach" and "Poison Heart". He was initially the band''s lead vocalist, though his (then) inability to sing and play bass at the same time resulted in original drummer Joey Ramone taking over the lead vocalist duties. Dee Dee would serve as the band''s bassist and songwriter from 1974 through 1989, when he left to pursue a short-lived career in hip hop music under the name Dee Dee King. He soon returned to his punk roots and released three solo albums featuring brand new songs, many of which were later recorded by the Ramones. He toured the world playing his new songs, Ramones songs and some old favorites in small clubs, and continued to write songs for the Ramones until 1996, when the band officially retired.

Dee Dee struggled with drug addiction for much of his life, particularly heroin. He began using drugs as a teenager, and continued to use for the majority of his adult life. He appeared to clean up his act in the early 1990s but began using heroin again some time later. He died from a heroin overdose in 2002.

Laird Cregar (July 28, 1913 – December 9, 1944) was an American film actor.

Samuel Laird Cregar was the youngest of six sons of Edward Matthews Cregar, a cricketer and member of a team called the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. They toured internationally in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Laird''s mother was the former Elizabeth Smith.

Laird Cregar was educated at Winchester College in England, spending his summers as a page boy and bit player with the Stratford-upon-Avon theatrical troupe. Upon completing his schooling, Cregar won a scholarship at California''s Pasadena Playhouse, supporting himself as a nightclub bouncer when funds ran out. So broke that at times he had to sleep in his car, Cregar forced Hollywood to pay attention to him by staging his own one-man show, in which he portrayed Oscar Wilde.

The blond-maned, blue-eyed comedian with the sad, droopy mustache first came in contact with the arts by honing in on his innate talents as a painter. In order to pay his art school tuition, he started organizing bands. At around the same time, he discovered that stand-up comedy was another way to allow his creative juices to flow. Martin''s early recognition as a humorist led to a recording contract, and, over the years, he would be Grammy-nominated several times for a number of eccentric comedy albums. His gimmick and allure came in the form of a dry, humorless delivery and a bland, highly conservative-looking demeanor, which masked a sly, witty and ultra-hip philosophy. Gaining popularity in the 1970s, he finally broke into TV with the cult soap opera parody "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" (1976) in which he played Garth Gimble, a volatile wife abuser whose comeuppance occurred in the form of an aluminum Christmas tree (impaled) in his home closet. Martin was so popular on the show that he was resurrected in the spin-off series "Fernwood 2 Night" (1977) as twin brother Barth Gimble, who was a co-host of the town''s television program along with Fred Willard''s Jerry Hubbard character. After this peak, Martin became a sought-after guest on the talk show circuit, not to mention variety specials and TV movies. He tried his hand at producing and starring in his own sitcom "Domestic Life" (1984) but the series failed. He also added his special brand of merriment to films over the years, some of them being decent, such as FM (1978), Serial (1980), Mr. Mom (1983) and Clue (1985) in the role of the tweedy-looking Colonel Mustard, while most have been either formula schtick or just plain drivel, as in Take This Job and Shove It (1981), Rented Lips (1988), which he produced and wrote, Cutting Class (1989), Far Out Man (1990) with Cheech &amp; Chong, and Mr. Write (1994). Martin''s first passion has always been art and the distinguished multi-media artist''s work has been showcased in galleries throughout the world. He also authored the book "Painting, Drawing and World," which is a compilation of ten years of his work. Mull is married to a composer and musician, Wendy, and they have a daughter.

He is most notably known for his starring role as Malik El Djebena in the 2009 award-winning French movie A Prophet by Jacques Audiard.

Rahim has demonstrated multilingual skills and an ear for accents, having played in Corsican and Arabic in addition to French in A Prophet, and in ancient Gaelic for his role as the seal prince in Kevin Macdonald''s The Eagle.

He says that he found refuge from the boredom of Belfort in cinema. Watching up to five movies a week during his youth, this habit that gave birth and fed his passion for the art.

After earning a Baccalauréat at the Lycée Condorcet of Belfort, he enrolled first in Sports and then Computer Science programs. After two subsequent years of an unmotivated boredom with the subjects in Strasbourg and Marseille, Rahim decided to pursue his passion and began to study film at the Paul Valéry University of Montpellier. His life as a film student was chronicled in a documentary by Cyril Mennegun titled "Tahar, student", aired on French TV channel France 5 in 2006.

Following this, Rahim moved to Paris in 2005 and studied drama at the Laboratoire de l''Acteur under Hélène Zidi-Chéruy while working in a factory during the week, and in a night club on weekends to make ends meet.

In mid 2006, after signing with an agent, Rahim won a part in the hit Canal+ television series La Commune written by Abdel Raouf Dafri. Dafri penned the first draft of the script to A Prophet. Rahim then met Audiard when the two coincidentally shared a cab while the two were leaving a set. Tahar introduced himself saying that "I knew it was Audiard and I said I was a fan but I think I was a bit silly" and was afterward very surprised that Audiard remembered him enough to contact him about A Prophet. After a two-line appearance in 2008 horror movie Inside starring Béatrice Dalle, he went through a gruelling three months of auditioning. After eight callbacks, he landed his breakthrough role.

Rahim is now set to star in controversial Chinese director Lou Ye''s movie Bitch. The director, twice banned from making movies by the Chinese government, likely met Tahar at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival where they were each presenting Spring Fever and A Prophet respectively. Bitch is the adaptation of the banned biography of Jie Liu Falin.

Although she was seen most often in comedies, Tobin also played the role of Cordelia in a Broadway production of King Lear in 1923. Popular with audiences, she was often praised by critics for her appearance and style rather than for her talent, however in 1929 she achieved a significant success in the play Fifty Million Frenchmen.

She played prominent supporting roles opposite such performers as Jeanette MacDonald, Nelson Eddy, Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Claudette Colbert, Joan Blondell and Kay Francis, but occasionally played starring roles, in films such as Golden Harvest (1933) and Easy to Love (1934).

He also appeared in several Shakespeare plays on Broadway, and in the original production of Eugene O''Neill''s The Iceman Cometh, as Harry Slade.

His stern, cold demeanor quickly stereotyped him in villainous, and/or unpleasant characters, although he could play a sympathetic role, as he did occasionally in such films as the 1957 TV-movie version of The Pied Piper of Hamelin.

Before signing with Paramount Pictures in the 1930s, Nussbaum had already changed his last name to Ankrum. Upon signing with the studio, he chose to use the name "Stephen Morris" before changing it to Morris Ankrum in 1939.

Ankrum''s stern visage and sharply defined features helped cast him in supporting roles as stalwart authority figures, including scientists, military men (particularly army officers), judges and even psychiatrists in more than 150 films, mostly B movies. One standout role was in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer''s production of Tennessee Johnson (1942), a biographical film about Andrew Johnson, the 17th U.S. president. As Sen. Jefferson Davis, Ankrum movingly addresses the United States Senate upon his resignation to lead the Confederate States of America as that republic''s first—and only—president. Ankrum''s film career was extensive and spanned 30 years. His credits were largely concentrated in the western and science-fiction genres.

After a discouraging stint in England to concentrate on his music, Peart returned home, where he joined a local Toronto band, Rush, in the summer of 1974.  Early in his career, Peart''s performance style was deeply rooted in hard rock. He drew most of his inspiration from drummers such as Keith Moon and John Bonham, players who were at the forefront of the British hard rock scene. As time passed, however, he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop, the company whose products Peart currently endorses.  Peart has received numerous awards for his musical performances, and is known for his technical proficiency and stamina.  In addition to being a musician, Peart is also a prolific writer, having published several memoirs about his travels. Peart is also Rush''s primary lyricist. In writing lyrics for Rush, Peart addresses universal themes and diverse subject matter including science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy, as well as secular, humanitarian and libertarian themes. All four of his books are travel-based non-fiction, though they diverge into his life and these subjects as well.  Peart currently resides in Santa Monica, California with his wife, photographer Carrie Nuttall, and daughter, Olivia Louise.

A studio exec saw her and asked if she would take a  screen test. She did, the studio was impressed with the result and put  her under contract. Nothing much came of it, however, other than bit  parts, and she moved to RKO. Nothing much happened there, either. She  had married actor James Dunn and decided to retire, which she did, in 1938.

Unfortunately,  her career never really took off, and she bounced around among several  studios. In 1948 she was involved in an auto accident in which she  received severe head injuries.

Those films included House of Rothschild (1934) and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939); the latter film is considered one of the best in the Sherlock Holmes series. During the early 1940s, he directed a number of comedies including Laurel &amp; Hardy''s A-Haunting We Will Go (1942). In the late 1940s, Werker worked for the B-picture film studio Eagle-Lion Films.

Maggie Moore was the stage name of the American-Australian actor Margaret Virginia Sullivan (10 April 1851 - March 15, 1926).

Sullivan was born at San Francisco, U.S.A., in 1851, and began her theatrical career at an early age. She established a local reputation, and having married J. C. Williamson came with him to Australia in 1874. They opened in Melbourne on 1 August in Struck Oil and were immediately successful. Some weeks later they went to Sydney and, after touring Australia, to India.

In 1876 Struck Oil played for 100 nights at the Adelphi Theatre, London, and was followed for a similar period by Arrah-na-Pogue, with Williamson as Shaun and his wife as Arrah. Other appearances were made in the provinces, and a successful visit was then paid to the United States.

In 1879 they were again in Australia and Maggie Moore began playing in Gilbert and Sullivan. Her voice was not large but she knew how to use it, and on occasions she took the parts of Josephine and Buttercup in HMS Pinafore, Mabel and Ruth in the Pirates of Penzance and once, when the actress chosen could not appear, Katisha in The Mikado. In Patience her part was Lady Jane. Possibly her best part in opera was Bettina, in Edmond Audran''s La Mascotte.

She was thoroughly adaptable, and after her husband had become a member of the firm of Williamson Garner and Musgrove and had practically given up acting, she appeared in sensational drama.

In about 1890 she was keeping alive with her vivacity and humour such parts as Biddy Roonan in The Shadows of a Great City, and Meg in Meg the Castaway. She visited her parents in San Francisco about this time and played at a benefit in Nan the Good-for-Nothing. Returning to Australia she was in various revivals of Struck Oi1 with John F. Forde as John Stofel.

About the close of the century Maggie Moore obtained a divorce from her husband, and between 1903 and 1908 travelled in the United States and Great Britain. In London she appeared with George Graves, Frank Danby, Billie Burke, and Carrie Moore.

Back in Australia she played a starring season between 1908 and 1912, occasionally reviving Struck Oil with H. R. Roberts, whom she had married, as John Stofel.

In 1915 she returned to the Royal Comic Opera Company, and for some years played smaller parts with a finish and distinction that was a revelation to the younger generation.

In 1918 she played the character of Mrs Karl Pfeiffer in Friendly Enemies, and it has been said of her that "she imbued the character with a dignity and gentle pathos which crowned her long career with fresh laurels".

In 1924 she celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of her first appearance in Australia, and in 1925 retired to California to live with her sister. There she was offered an engagement in Lightnin'' with J. D. O''Hara, but did not accept it.

Maggie Moore died at San Francisco after an operation on March 15, 1926. Her second husband predeceased her.

She was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. (Section T, Row 22, Area 13, Grave 4)

Vanessa has been an entertainer from a very early age, appearing in her first theatre production at the age of 4. The budding actress appeared on stage throughout her childhood and as a teenager, dancing and acting.

In 2000, she was a Miss South Africa finalist where she was spotted by one of the most sought after modeling agencies in South Africa. Her modeling career took her to various exotic destinations all over the world and she lived between London, Hamburg and Cape Town. She has appeared on countless magazine covers such as Elle, Shape, Woman & Home, Bicycling, and Living & Loving, and has been the face of a number of successful campaigns.

Vanessa’s love of entertainment lead her to study drama to further her acting career in film and television, but not before gaining diplomas in both marketing and business management. She recently completed a course in Digital Marketing through the Red & Yellow School.

Her successful television career started well before her film career did, having presented for Groen (Kyknet), Top Billing (SABC 3), AgriTV (SABC 1), Superdance (ETV) and Wildlife Video Cast (Asia). She also hosted her own entertainment slot on 2 Oceans Vibe Radio, and is an avid free-lance writer and voice artist.

Her biggest career success came in 2009 when she was cast as the leading lady for District 9 directed by Neill Blomkamp and produced by Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) which sat at number 1 at the Box Office for 3 weeks, taking in more than $200 000 million. It was nominated for 4 Oscars. She also had small roles in The Sweet Shop, Blood Diamond and Hey Boy.

Vanessa competed in MNET’s “Survivor Maldives – Celebs vs Plebs” in 2011, which she describes as a phenomenal life changing experience. It’s this adventurous spirit, which forms the foundation of her great love for sport. She is a keen trail runner, cyclist and plays the odd game of golf too. She is also a water sports enthusiast who enjoys scuba diving and water skiing.

Being married to one of South Africa’s most successful sportsmen, Ryan Sandes, only fortified her love for sport even more. At the end of 2012 she started taking her cycling seriously and raced competitively for a number of years. Vanessa is a respected endurance athlete having completed two ABSA Cape Epic’s, the Leadville 100 miler (Colorado, USA), the Otter Trail Run and many other races.

Although still active within the entertainment industry, MC-ing, recording voice-overs, and filming corporate videos and TV commercials, Vanessa is a keen businesswoman and “influencer” involved in marketing and digital media management.

Vanessa says that the greatest accomplishment of her life yet, is becoming a mother - she recently became a mum to Max, and her little boy keeps her on her toes!

She enjoys inspiring men, woman and children to live positive, healthier, and more active lifestyles. Her love for the outdoors and people creates the foundation of the environmental and social messages she shares with her followers. She considers the charity work she’s involved with as a very important part of her life and works with organisations such as such The Pink Drive, Lettie Love Fund, the Laureus Foundation, SPCA and DARG (Domestic Animal Rescue Group).', NULL, 1, '/h7FoJwTm8erZCkPMXKtRDmun165.jpg'),

Cope also performed the majority of the background voice work in the film; voicing most of the police, pilot and other background voices in addition to the voice of the cameraman Trent.For the creation of the character of Christopher Johnson the film used a process similar to the creation of the character of Gollum played by Andy Serkis in Peter Jackson''s Lord of the Rings trilogy using a CGI character modeled on the performance of an actor. This allowed for on-camera performances by the actor, allowing the aliens to interact with the other cast members. Cope is the grandson of the South African writer Jack Cope.

Cope trained as a magician at age 9 and briefly worked as a filler act in a South African circus at age 13. He continued to perform professionally on a part-time basis until he completed his schooling. Later, once he had finished school, he went to London to become a street performer.

At the age of 29 he returned to South Africa and performed stand-up comedy at venues and events around the country.

Cope wrote for and acted in the television comedy show The Pure Monate Show.

Louis Daniel Armstrong  (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana.

Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an "inventive" cornet and trumpet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the music''s focus from collective improvisation to solo performance.

With his instantly recognizable deep and distinctive gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing, vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics.

Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong''s influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general.

Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to "cross over," whose skin-color was secondary to his amazing talent in an America that was severely racially divided. It allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a person of color. While he rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, he was privately a huge supporter of the Civil Rights movement in America.

Jean Harlow (March 3, 1911 – June 7, 1937) was an American film actress and sex symbol of the 1930s. Known as the "Blonde Bombshell" and the "Platinum Blonde" (due to her platinum blonde hair), Harlow was ranked one of the greatest movie stars of all time by the American Film Institute. She starred in several films, mainly designed to showcase her magnetic sex appeal and strong screen presence, before making the transition to more developed roles and achieving massive fame under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Harlow''s enormous popularity and "laughing vamp" image were in distinct contrast to her personal life, which was marred by disappointment, tragedy, and ultimately her sudden death from renal failure at age 26.

Julie Bishop (August 30, 1914 – August 30, 2001) was an American film and television actress. She appeared in over 80 films between 1923 and 1957.

Bishop was born Jacqueline Wells and used her birth name professionally through 1941. She also appeared on stage (and in one film) as Diane Duval. She was a child actress, beginning her career in 1923. Early on, she appeared in several Laurel and Hardy films (Any Old Port! and The Bohemian Girl), and she settled on the name by which she is best remembered when offered a contract by Warner Bros. on the condition that she change her name, which was associated with her almost exclusively B-movie appearances through 1941 (amounting to nearly 50 films over 17 years). She chose the name because it matched the monograms on her luggage (she had for a time been married to Walter Booth Brooks III, a writer).

She made 16 films at Warners, including a supporting role in 1943''s Princess O''Rourke, supporting Olivia de Havilland and Robert Cummings. While filming, she met her second husband, Clarence Shoop, a pilot. She was Humphrey Bogart''s leading lady in Action in the North Atlantic (1943), played Ira Gershwin''s wife in the biopic Rhapsody in Blue (1945), and closed out her Warners years in 1946''s Cinderella Jones.

In 1949, Bishop played a down-on-her-luck wife and mother in the Sands of Iwo Jima, opposite John Wayne. She was among several former Wayne co-stars (including Laraine Day, Ann Doran, Jan Sterling, and Claire Trevor) who joined the actor in 1954''s aviation drama, The High and the Mighty.

Thrice married, Bishop had a son, Steve, a physician and pilot, and a daughter, actress Pamela Susan Shoop, both by her second marriage, Gen. Clarence A. Shoop, a test pilot who flew for Howard Hughes and later became vice president of Hughes Aircraft; they were married from 1944 until his death in 1968. Her first marriage ended in divorce and her third with her death.

Despite abandoning traditional schooling, Edna continued to study the performing arts, including speech and piano. One of her first jobs was as pianist with an all female orchestra which toured America around the turn of the century. By 1917 she had achieved success on Broadway in the hit play "Oh, Boy". By 1923 she had appeared in her first film. Edna May Oliver seems to have been born to play the classics of American and British literature. Some of her most memorable film roles were in adaptations of works of Charles Dickens. Although some have described her as plain or "horse faced", Edna May Oliver''s comedic talents lent a beautiful droll warmth to her characters. She was usually called upon to play less glamorous roles such as a spinsters, but she played them with such soul, wit, and depth that to this day she remains one of the best loved of Hollywood''s character actresses. A fine example of her comedic talent can be found in Laugh and Get Rich (1931). Here we find her playing a role almost autobiographical in nature, that of a proud woman with Boston roots who has married "down". As the plot unwinds, she is invited to a society gala despite her modest circumstances. At the gala she becomes tipsy. With a frolicsome air Edna May seems to use the role to gently mock her real self. Her slightly drunk character seizes upon a bit of flattery, and alluding to her old New England family, proudly proclaims to each who will listen, "I am a Cranston. That explains everything!".

Conway started out as an actor, joining a repertory theater group straight out of high school. He then moved into films and, in 1911, became a member of D.W. Griffith''s stock company, appearing primarily in westerns. Four years later, he made his mark as a director and gained valuable experience at Universal (1916–17 and 1921–23), before moving on to MGM in 1925. He remained there until 1948, often helming prestige assignments featuring the studio''s top male star, Clark Gable: Boom Town (1940), Honky Tonk (1941), The Hucksters (1947) – all solid box office hits.

Conway was one of a team of MGM contract directors, who forsook any pretense to a specific individual style in favor of working within the strictures set forth by studio management. A thoroughly competent craftsman, he delivered commercially successful entertainments, on time, and within budget. Conway may not have achieved fame as a creative genius, but the majority of his films remain eminently entertaining to this day.

In his most famous film, A Tale of Two Cities (1935), he utilized 17,000 extras for the Paris mob scenes alone. This spectacular adaptation of the Dickens classic is still regarded by many as the definitive screen version. Another popular hit was the sophisticated all-star comedy Libeled Lady (1936), with the New York Times reviewer commenting on Conway''s "agile direction". Conway also directed Viva Villa!, a hit MGM film starring Wallace Beery that was nominated for four Academy Awards.

Pygram was born in Cootamundra, New South Wales and raised in Wagga Wagga, where, as a teen, he was a drummer in a dance group. He initially studied art at Riverina College of Advanced Education, but later changed majors to primary school education.[1] While in college, he became a member of a theatre troupe known as the Riverina Trucking Company.[1]Before acting in films and television, he was a regular on the Australian theatre circuit. In 2005, he made a brief cameo in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith as a young Grand Moff Tarkin, because of his resemblance to the late Peter Cushing, who portrayed the same character 28 years previously in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.  Due to the brevity of his Star Wars cameo, and the makeup he wore onFarscape, Pygram''s real face may now be known best for his appearance on the TV show Lost, as a faith healer named Isaac of Uluru.

His first foray into feature films was with Philip Ridley''s The Reflecting Skin where he was the producer along with Ray Burdis. Dominic produced The Krays, also written by Philip Ridley and starring Gary and Martin Kemp.

In 1995 Dominic produced The Passion of Darkly Noon. Co-financed by the UK, Germany and Belgium this film attracted big American stars in the form of Brendan Fraser and Ashley Judd and went on to become a cult hit in the festival circuit, winning several awards, including Best Director at the Porto Film Festival. 1995 also saw Anciano step away from the arthouse fold to work on Stephen Norrington''s Death Machine, where he also made a cameo appearance as a corpse is a restaurant!!

Ray Burdis (born Oct 1959 in London) is an English actor, screenwriter, director and film producer.

Burdis started acting at eleven years old when he trained at the Anna Scher Theatre in Islington. He appeared in an episode of the classic BBC sitcom Steptoe and Son when he was fifteen, but his first major role was at the age of sixteen, in the Thames Television series You Must Be Joking! , which he also co-created and wrote. He also starred with Phil Daniels in Four Idle Hands, at the time having two hit networked television shows running alternately in the same hour.

In 1978 Burdis auditioned for a presenting job on the BBC children''s programme Blue Peter as a replacement for John Noakes. Richard Marson''s book celebrating the show''s fiftieth anniversary records this fact and film of the audition was shown at a BAFTA celebration in October 2008.

Burdis came to real prominence when he took the part of cowardly inmate Eckersley in the controversial movie Scum in 1979. He had played the same role two years earlier in a BBC television version of the story, although this was not transmitted for many years due to its graphic nature, hence the cinematic re-make. He later had a small role alongside Daniel Day-Lewis in the film Gandhi (1982).

Burdis then played a supporting role as Richard, a gay neighbour in Channel 4''s short-lived sitcom "Dream Stuffing" in 1984. After this, he played ambitious photographer Nick Tyler in the BBC comedy Three Up, Two Down. His character was the son and son-in-law respectively of the two lead characters, played by Michael Elphick and Angela Thorne. The series rated over 17million viewers and went on for 5 seasons.

In addition to acting, Burdis also co-founded Fugitive - an independent film, television and music production company which started life as a premier music video producer, producing videos for internationally renowned artists such as Elton John, Queen, Tina Turner and George Michael, placing itself in the Top 5 international music video production companies. Burdis also produced The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for television, the largest ever live outside broadcast at the time, it was transmitted in every country around the world to an audience 40% larger than Live Aid. Burdis’ first foray into television drama was creating the series The Fear, for Euston Films, which was broadcast on the ITV Network. The series was critically acclaimed and was based on the unpublicised real-life gangster scene of the late 1980s.

Burdis has subsequently concentrated more on writing, producing and directing. He was the producer of The Krays, the critically acclaimed biopic of the East End gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray written by Philip Ridley, and also co-wrote-produced and directed the movies Final Cut and Love, Honour and Obey starring such actors as Jude Law, Jonny Lee Miller, Kathy Burke, Ray Winstone, Rhys Ifans. He also created, co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in the television police fly on the wall docu-comedy Operation Good Guys for three series. The series was awarded the Silver Rose for Best Sitcom and the Prix de la Presse, voted for by the International Press, at the Montreux Golden Rose Festival.

Turning his hand once again to acting he went on to co-star in the BBC Two comedy drama series Manchild for two series, along with Nigel Havers, Anthony Head and Don Warrington.

Having launched a new film production company Britflick Productions in 2010, Ray Burdis is shooting the controversial film, ''The Wee Man'' which is scheduled for production in the late summer 2011 in association with Carnaby films.

Ray also had an interesting Music background in his teens: Great British Heroes had their roots in Stars &amp; Stripes, a North London band formed early in 1976 by Ray Burdis (vocals), Graham Reed (gtr), Vince (b) and Rowland Rivron (d). In mid-’76 Rivron quit (later to be a TV celebrity). In the autumn the group entered Strawberry Studios in London to record a single for Lightning Records. At Christmas Great British Heroes hired a manager, Jeff Miller, whose lawyer promptly declared the proposed Lightning contract “not a good idea”: the single was shelved, and in November 1978. Great British Heroes (or GBH, as they were sometimes advertised) played all the usual London venues including The Rock Garden, Upstairs at Ronnie Scott’s, the Nashville and even the Roxy, as well as touring Denmark. Eventually, in late 1979 Ray Burdis quit to concentrate on film work (as both an actor and director he would become a central figure in British TV and cinema)

Leonard went from Bedales School to graduate from the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2003, and then won a BBC Radio Drama Carleton Hobbs bursary.

Her radio credits include playing Lady Mabel in a twelve-part adaptation of Anthony Trollope''s series of political novels, and Goodwill in The Pilgrim''s Progress. On television she had an ongoing role in 50s-set detective series Jericho starring Robert Lindsay, and appeared in True True Lie (2006) and The Long Walk to Finchley (2008), along with a cameo in Rome (2006, The Stolen Eagle), and as a nurse in the BBC''s Casualty 1909.

Leonard appeared on stage as Polyxena in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Hecuba starring Vanessa Redgrave and alongside Francesca Annis in the National Theatre''s production of Time and the Conways. In 2005 Leonard appeared as Caroline Cushing in the original Donmar Theatre and West End productions of Frost/Nixon.

In 2008 Leonard played a major role in the BBC re-make of The 39 Steps. Part of the Christmas scheduling, its first showing was the most watched program on BBC One on that day. Leonard starred as Cynthia in Joanna Hogg''s 2010 feature film Archipelago.

Robert Walter Quarry (3 November 1925 – 20 February 2009) was an American actor, known for several prominent horror film roles.

Quarry was born in Santa Rosa, California, the son of Mable and Paul Quarry, a doctor. His films include Count Yorga, Vampire (1970), its sequel The Return of Count Yorga (1971), and Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972), in which he played alchemist Dr. Biederbeck pitted against Vincent Price''s Phibes in a race to find the mythical elixir of eternal life. Although it is well-known that Price did not care for his co-star - once, when Quarry was singing in his dressing room during the making of Dr Phibes Rises Again, he said to Price, "You didn''t know I could sing did you?" and Price replied: "Well I knew you couldn''t act." - the two were later also paired in Madhouse (1974). American International Pictures had plans for Quarry to succeed Price, but the decline in the company''s fortunes, and old style horror films falling out of fashion, meant that it never happened. Quarry did make further horror film appearances, as the hippy guru vampire Khorda in 1973''s The Deathmaster and as a gangster in the 1974 zombie movie Sugar Hill. A third Count Yorga film was often rumored to be in the works, but never materialised.

Quarry''s career was further set back by a road accident that resulted in serious facial injuries (in which he was hit by a drunk driver), but he made several memorable guest appearances on TV shows, notably The Rockford Files episode, "Requiem For a Funny Box", as Lee Russo. He also played disfigured gunrunner Commander Corliss in the Buck Rogers in the 25th Century episode "Return of the Fighting 69th". In the 1980s and 1990s, he returned to film, becoming a favorite of director Fred Olen Ray.

Quarry died at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California at the age of 83.

Thraves made one more short film, his most successful to date - I Just Want To Kiss You (1997), starring Martin Freeman predating his role as Tim in Ricky Gervais''s The Office, won the Fox Searchlight Award for Best Short Film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 1998.

Mary Elizabeth Patterson (November 22, 1874 – January 31, 1966) was an American theatre, film, and television character actress who gained popular recognition late in her career playing the elderly neighbor Matilda Trumbull on the television comedy series I Love Lucy.

In 1926, at the age of 51, Patterson was cast in her first movie, a silent film, The Boy Friend. Transitioning successfully into the era of "talkies", she remained a very busy actress in Hollywood throughout the 1930s, averaging more than five films a year during that decade, usually in supporting roles. A few of her screen credits at that time include Tarnished Lady; Husband''s Holiday; A Bill of Divorcement; So Big!; The Story of Temple Drake; Hold Your Man; Dinner at Eight; High, Wide, and Handsome; and No Man of Her Own. She also appeared in the role of Susan in two adaptations of John Willard''s popular play The Cat and the Canary: The Cat Creeps in 1930 and The Cat and the Canary in 1939.

Patterson continued to perform frequently in the 1940s, when she was cast in more than 30 additional films. Among her notable roles is her 1949 portrayal of the heroic character Eunice Habersham in the groundbreaking racial crime drama Intruder in the Dust, a film based on the William Faulkner novel of the same name and set in the Deep South. Although she would appear in a few more feature films in the 1950s, such as Washington Story and Pal Joey, Patterson by then began to focus her work increasingly on roles in the rapidly expanding medium of television.

In 1952, at the age of 77, Patterson made her first appearance on the hit CBS-TV sitcom I Love Lucy in the episode "The Marriage License".  Her character on I Love Lucy proved to be so popular among viewers, as well as useful to the writers of the series, that she continued in the role for three more years, often serving in episode storylines as a convenient babysitter for "Little Ricky".

Prior to, during, and after her work on I Love Lucy, Patterson appeared in many other American television series during the 1950s and early 1960s. Her first credited performance on the "small screen" was in March 1950 in "The Walking Stick", a teleplay on the NBC anthology series The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre. During the 11 years after that initial televised performance to her final role on television in 1961, she portrayed characters in a variety of other series, including Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, Studio One in Hollywood, General Electric Theater, Stage 7, Lux Video Theatre, Crossroads, The Star and the Story, The Adventures of Jim Bowie, Adventures of Superman, New York Confidential, 77 Sunset Strip, Johnny Stacatto, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Playhouse 90, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, and The New Breed.

Patterson, who never married, lived at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel during her 35-year film and television career.. On January 31, 1966, she died at age 91 in Los Angeles of complications from pneumonia.

Alan Curtis (July 24, 1909 - February 2, 1953) was an American film actor appearing in over 50 films.

Born Harry Ueberroth in Chicago, Illinois, he began his career as a model before becoming an actor, appearing in local newspaper ads. His looks did not go unnoticed in Hollywood. He began appearing in films in the late 1930s (including a Technicolor appearance in the Alice Faye-Don Ameche film Hollywood Cavalcade and a memorable role in High Sierra (1941). He is probably best known as one of the romantic leads in Abbott and Costello''s first hit movie Buck Privates.

His chance for leading-man stardom came when he replaced the unwilling John Garfield in the 1943 production Flesh and Fantasy. Curtis played a ruthless killer opposite Gloria Jean. Unfortunately for both actors, the studio removed their performances from the final film. The footage was later expanded into a B-picture melodrama Destiny. The film failed to establish Curtis as a major-name star, but it did typecast him in hardbitten roles, like the man framed for murder in Phantom Lady (1944) and the detective Philo Vance.

He starred in over two dozen movies and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Alan Curtis was married three times; his wives included actresses Priscilla Lawson and Ilona Massey. He died from complications during an operation in New York City, New York, he was 43. He is buried in the Ueberroth family plot in Evanston, Illinois.

Richard Ross Eyer (born May 6, 1945, Santa Monica, California) is a former American child actor during the 1950s and 1960s who taught elementary school in the eastern Sierra city of Bishop in Inyo County until he retired in 2006. He is the older brother of Robert Eyer (b. May 6, 1948), another child actor of the period who is deceased.

In 1960–1961, Eyer was cast in the role of the teenaged David "Davey" Kane on the ABC television Western series Stagecoach West, having portrayed the fictional son of stagecoach co-owner Simon Kane, played by the late Robert Bray. The series, a production of Dick Powell''s Four Star Television, also starred Wayne Rogers, later Trapper John on M*A*S*H.

Eyer was a boy with "''the clean-cut, all-American look" who won "personality contests" and other competitions before he made his film debut in the early 1950s. In 1956, he was the youngster who runs "afowl" of the goose in director William Wyler''s Friendly Persuasion. Science fiction viewers will remember him for the starring role in The Invisible Boy, which was producer Nicholas Nayfack''s independent sequel to MGM''s Forbidden Planet. In The Desperate Hours (1955), Eyer played Frederic March''s dangerously impulsive son. His last film was The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad in 1958. He portrayed the metallic-voiced Baronni the Genie. He also starred in the Warner Bros. late ''50s western, "Fort Dobbs", with Clint Walker &amp; Virginia Mayo.

In a 1995 interview, Eyer credited his mother for the promotion of his acting career. "It was all her work that did it. I had curly hair, freckles, and people would say what a cute kid he was and all that; so my mother entered me in some children’s personality contests, and I won one of these which had been held at the Hollywood Bowl, and I guess that one was the springboard in getting me started. After that, I was hired for some television commercials and some modeling jobs, and this led into other things ... I was around fourteen when I did Stagecoach West ... My last role was at age 21, appearing in an episode of [ABC''s] Combat!."

He appeared in more than one hundred episodes of various television programs, including Rod Cameron''s syndicated City Detective, when he was eight years of age.

Other appearances include Arrest and Trial, Stoney Burke, Wagon Train, Father Knows Best, Mr. Novak, Gunsmoke, Lassie, Rawhide and General Electric Theater.
